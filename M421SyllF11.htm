<big><b>The course:</b></big>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Math 421 is
really two courses but they work well together; this is why it is 4.0
credits.<br>
<br>
First we do a short course in vector
calculus, completing multivariable calculus.&nbsp; That is the subject
which you started in
Calculus III (Math 202).&nbsp; This part of Math 421 gives you the
tools to do classical electricity and magnetism, but just as directly
helps with fluids and elastic deformation and any other "field
theory" that uses vector fields.&nbsp; The remaining two thirds of the
course is
an introduction to partial differential equations (PDEs) and their
solution by
separation
of variables.&nbsp; We cover the
<span style="font-style: italic;">heat</span>, <span
 style="font-style: italic;">wave</span>, and <span
 style="font-style: italic;">potential</span> equations (PDEs).&nbsp;
There
will be boundary value problems and initial-and-boundary value problems
for PDEs on nice domains.&nbsp; We will develop the elementary theory
of Fourier
series and orthogonal functions, as this is the substance of the
separation of
variables technique.<br>
<br>
Lectures and homework together form the
core of the class.&nbsp; <span style="font-weight: bold;">There is a
lot of homework</span>, both calculations
and arguments.&nbsp; Formal proofs will not be expected.&nbsp; Computer
experimentation is encouraged but is not a part of the
course.&nbsp; You are expected to ask questions in class
about recent lectures or homework assignments.<br>
<br>
<br>
<b><font size="+1">Prerequisites:</font></b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Math
302 (ordinary) Differential Equations is the only prerequisite, but
Math
302 requires Math 202 Calculus
III, which is equally a prerequisite for Math 421. <br>
<b><font size="+1"><br>
<br>
</font></b><big><b>Policies and makeup exams:</b></big>&nbsp;&nbsp; The
department
has specific policies on incompletes, late withdrawals, and early final
examinations, etc; see <a
 href="http://www.dms.uaf.edu/dms/Policies.html">www.dms.uaf.edu/dms/Policies.html</a>
. &nbsp;You are covered by the UAF Honor Code.&nbsp; I will work with
the Office of Disabilities Services (203 WHIT, 474-7043) to provide
reasonable accommodation to student with disabilities.&nbsp;&nbsp;
I will create
makeup versions of exams provided I have a convincing reason to do so
at least two class days before the exam, and the makeup must occur no
later than two class days after the exam date.<br>

Goals and related courses:</font></b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In Math 421
you'll get a
clear, detailed presentation of the ideas in vector calculus, which
you just touched on in the first calculus sequence, and then you get an
introduction to partial differential equations (PDEs) and Fourier
series.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Why do vector calculus?&nbsp; It is the
mathematical core of electricity &amp; magnetism (e.g. PHYS 331/332 and
EE 311).&nbsp; It is the mathematical core of the study of fluids of
all types (e.g. air, water, ice, plasma, earth's mantle; see
ME 451, MSL 629, PHYS 614, PHYS 629, ...) and the deformation of
materials.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; PDEs,
and the
Fourier series which arise in their solutions, applies in many
places.&nbsp; They
occur in all of the contexts in which vector calculus is useful, but
also in quantum mechanics and vibrations and other applications with a
less explicit "vector" feel.&nbsp; Our
coverage of Fourier
series is also useful in understanding signals; compare EE 451.&nbsp;
In the development of mathematics, understanding Fourier series was
central to
developing real analysis as the theory of calculus, as it is taught
in Math 401 for example.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; There is a caviat about the PDEs part of the course,
namely, that the methods we use only work (directly) for <i>linear</i>
equations with <i>constant coefficients</i> in <i>nice domains</i>.&nbsp;
You
will
get
a feeling for these restrictions, but
you may not see at first how severe the restrictions are because we
will not
look at other kinds of PDE problems in this first course.&nbsp;
In future work you might approximate harder problems (nonlinear
or non-constant coefficient or irregular domain) by simpler problems of
the type we solve.<br>
