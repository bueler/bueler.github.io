J. Stewart, <em>Calculus</em>, Early Transcendentals, 8th ed., Brooks-Cole 2015<br>
<br>

You will need WebAssign access.  We cover Chapters 6--11 of this book.

<h3 style="text-align:left;"> Prerequisites:</h3>

Placement into MATH 252 is by passing MATH 251 with a grade of C- or better, or by earning a 4 or 5 on the AB or BC AP Calculus exam.  Students who have not met the current placement requirements within the last two years will be dropped within the first two weeks of the course.

<h3 style="text-align:left;"> Course content: </h3>

This course continues the core concepts in single-variable Calculus.  The topics include techniques of integration, applications of integration, parameterized curves, polar coordinates, and applications and convergence of sequences and series.<br>
<br>

Getting the most out of the lectures, recitation section, and homework is <em>your</em> responsibility.  (Samaneh and I will make them worth your time!)  You <em>should</em> ask questions in lecture and recitation, both about the new content and about the homework assignments.<br>

<h3 style="text-align:left;">Graded Work, and How Your Grade is Determined:</h3>

Your grade will be determined from three Exams, plus weekly Quizzes, Written Homework, and WebAssign.<br><br>

Based on the score computed using the above percentages I guarantee grades according to this schedule:<br>
<br>

<table cols="2" width="80%">

      <td valign="top" width="40%"><b>Score</b></td>
      <td valign="top" width="40%"><b>Grade</b></td>

      <td>A</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>79 - 89 %</td>
      <td>B</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>68 - 78 %</td>
      <td>C</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>57 - 67 %</td>
      <td>D</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>0 - 56 %</td>
      <td>F</td>
    </tr>
</table>
<br>

This schedule is a lower-bound guarantee.  That is, I reserve the right to increase your grade <i>above</i> this schedule based on the actual difficulty of the work and/or upon average class performance.  I will assign plusses and minuses at my discretion.<br>
<br>

<h3 style="text-align:left;">What you do each week:</h3>

<em>Every Wednesday in the semester</em> is either a Quiz or an Exam.  The Quizzes and Exams are closed-book and closed-note.  The Quizzes will be during the last 25 minutes of the Wednesday lecture period, while the Midterm Exams will use the full hour.<br>
<br>

The Written Homework is the work sheet handed out on Tuesdays in the recitation section.  It needs to be completed and turned-in by the following Monday.<br>
<br>

The WebAssignments are intended to be mostly routine problems while the Written Homework has more-interesting problems which take more time.  On the WebAssign problems you will be shown the answer and solution after two tries, and you'll have three additional tries, so there is no excuse for not getting 100% on the WebAssignments.<br>
<br>


<h3 style="text-align:left;">Getting help:</h3>

Please plan to ask me and Samaneh many questions during the semester.  If you need more help there is the Math Lab in Chapman 305 (<a href="https://uaf.edu/dms/mathlab/math-and-stat-lab-schedul-1/">uaf.edu/dms/mathlab/math-and-stat-lab-schedul-1</a>) as well as one-on-one tutoring in Eielson 302 (<a href="https://uaf.edu/dms/mathlab/one-on-one-tutoring/">uaf.edu/dms/mathlab/one-on-one-tutoring</a>).<br>
<br>


<h3 style="text-align:left;">Policies:</h3>

The Dept of Mathematics and Statistics has reasonable policies on incompletes, late withdrawals, early final examinations, etc.; see <a href="http://www.uaf.edu/dms/policies/">www.uaf.edu/dms/policies</a>. &nbsp;  You are covered by the UAF Student Code of Conduct. &nbsp;  I will work with the Office of Disabilities Services (208 WHIT, 474-5655) to provide reasonable accommodation to student with disabilities.<br>
