supplementary slides
====================

This is a sketch of two sets of slides I will write for Math 617 Functional Analysis.  The purpose is partly to make up for missed days and partly to back-fill finite-dimensional linear algebra.

* Finite-dimensional spectral theory I

    * C^n vector space with inner product
    * recall meaning of basis
    * Gram-Schmidt process
    * unitary matrices
    * G-S as QR
    * recall def'n of eigenvalue and eigenvector
    * symmetry implies real eigenvalues and orthogonal eigenvectors
    * Schur decomposition (Thm 7.1.3 in Golub & vanLoan; see also Lecture 24 in Trefethen & Bau)
    * Schur for normal is spectral theorem, i.e. principal axes thm

* Finite-dimensional spectral theory II

    * singular value decomposition
    * SVD vs eigenvalues
    * SVD answers invertibility, rank, nullity, conditioning questions
    * low rank approximations
