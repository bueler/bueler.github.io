<b><font size="+1">Course Description:</font></b>&nbsp; 3.0
credits.&nbsp; Methods for numerically approximating partial
differential equations (PDEs) and related problems on computers; PDEs
are the underlying structure for most problems of flow, fields,
thermodynamics, deformation, quantum fields, curvature, etc. &nbsp;
Mathematical analysis of these numerical methods.&nbsp; Practical and
abstract approaches to this numerical analysis:&nbsp; (i) how are these
methods implemented, verified, and used?&nbsp; (ii) why are they stable
and do we know in advance that they converge?<br>
<br>
Most classtime will be lecture, with <span style="font-style: italic;">Matlab/Octave/Pylab
(=MOP)</span> demonstrations whenever I can fit them in.&nbsp; I will
help you started with <span style="font-style: italic;">MOP</span>,
but you must show initiative in learning to do actual numerical
computation.&nbsp; Homework assignments and a student-chosen project
will include actual implementation in <span style="font-style: italic;">MOP</span>.<br>
<br>
Abstract but precise thought is essential in order to understand the
choices among numerical methods one faces in solving major
problems.&nbsp; Thus all homework assignments will have mathematical
exercises, and in these you will be asked to "show" and "prove".&nbsp;
Formal proof style is not important, but you'll need to give clear
presentations of sufficiently-general logical arguments.<br>
<br>
The emphasis is on finite difference methods.&nbsp; I will only gloss
spectral methods, finite elements, finite volume methods.&nbsp; We will
think in terms of vectors and matrices, and not be satisfied with lots
of numbers from a computer program.&nbsp; Instead of a list of finite
difference schemes, for instance, we will seek the underlying linear
algebra structure.&nbsp; The course will include some real nonlinear
examples, for which one uses a sequence of approximating linear
problems.<br>
<br>
<b><font size="+1">Goals:&nbsp;</font></b> At the end this course you
will not be a professional numerical analyst.&nbsp; But you will be
able to evaluate and use many numerical tools for solving scientific
and engineering problems, and you will be able to code some of the
basic methods (i.e. for the purpose of prototyping more serious
solutions).&nbsp; Furthermore you will have the mathematical start
needed to take the next steps to learn the finite element method,
spectral methods, parallel-izable matrix methods.<br>
<br style="font-weight: bold;">
<big><span style="font-weight: bold;">Calendar:</span></big>&nbsp; A
day-to-day tentative schedule for the semester is at&nbsp;<a
 href="Math615S12.htm">www.dms.uaf.edu/~bueler/Math615S12.htm</a>.<br>
<br>
<b><big>Prerequisites:</big>&nbsp;</b> <span
 style="font-style: italic;">Informally: </span>undergraduate ordinary
differential equations, undergraduate linear algebra, exposure to the
basic ideas of numerical analysis, and exposure to Fourier series and
separation of variables (for solving the classical linear PDE boundary
value problems).&nbsp; Also some exposure to computer programming.<span
 style="font-style: italic;">&nbsp; Formally</span>: The prerequisites
are<span style="font-style: italic;"></span> MATH 302, MATH 310, MATH
314, and MATH 421 or permission of the instructor.&nbsp; CS 201 and
MATH 422 are not specifically needed, though they are nice things to
know.<br>
<br>
<b><big>Textbook:</big>&nbsp;</b> The <span style="font-weight: bold;">required</span>
text is K. Morton and D. Mayers, <span style="font-style: italic;">Numerical

Solution
of Partial Differential Equations</span>, 2nd ed. Cambridge
Univ. Press 2005. There are other textbooks on numerical analysis of
PDEs, but I actually <span style="font-style: italic;">like</span>
this one.&nbsp; We will cover chapters 1, 2, 3, 4, first half of 5,
some of 6, and a little of 7.&nbsp; Four other texts are recommended,
of which two are freely available online a page at a time.&nbsp; See <a
 href="Math615S10.htm">www.dms.uaf.edu/~bueler/Math615S12.htm</a><br>
<span style="font-weight: bold;"></span><br>
<b><font size="+1">Your Grade = Homework + Project</font></b><b><font
 size="+1"> + Midterm</font></b><b><font size="+1">:</font></b>&nbsp; <b>Fifty
percent</b> of the course, and the grade, will be based on nearly <b>weekly
homework
assignments</b>, including on the last assignment which will
be worth double and which is a modest <span style="font-weight: bold;">take-home

final
exam</span>.&nbsp; Here is where you will learn the mathematics
and gain breadth and perspective.&nbsp; You will be asked to think
abstractly on some problems and to use <i>MOP</i> on many
others.&nbsp;&nbsp; (For <span style="font-style: italic;">MOP</span>
problems expect to make a program about a half-page long.)<br>
<br>
It is assumed that students in this class have in mind<span
 style="font-style: italic;">, </span><i>or can acquire, </i>specific
modelling problems in applied fields which can be used for a <span
 style="font-weight: bold;">project</span>.&nbsp;&nbsp; These will
mostly, but not exclusively, be PDE problems.&nbsp; Students often use
a simplification of a thesis/dissertation project, for instance.&nbsp;
I am eager to help and advise on choosing and refining such
problems.&nbsp; <span style="font-weight: bold;">Thirty-five</span><b>
percent</b> of the grade in the course will be on the project.&nbsp;
Two project assignments will be given, the first part a preparatory
stage due midsemester, and the remainder due at finals time.&nbsp; Both
mathematical analysis and actual numerical computation are required on
your project.<br>
<br>
Finally, there will be a one-hour in-class <span
 style="font-weight: bold;">midterm exam</span> worth only <span
 style="font-weight: bold;">fifteen percent</span> of the course
grade.&nbsp; The purpose is to give a midsemester opportunity to review
basics before expanding our goals in the second half.<br>

You

are
covered by the UAF Honor Code.&nbsp; I will work with the Office of
Disabilities Services (208 Whitman, 474-5655) to provide reasonable
accommodation to student with disabilities.<br>
<p><b><font size="+1">Programming in the course:</font></b>&nbsp; You
will use <i><a href="http://www.mathworks.com/">Matlab</a></i>, <a
 href="http://www.gnu.org/software/octave/"><span
 style="font-style: italic;">Octave</span></a>, or <span
 style="font-style: italic;">Pylab</span> (=<a

 href="http://www.scipy.org/SciPy"><span style="font-style: italic;">scipy</span></a>+<a
 href="http://matplotlib.sourceforge.net/"><span
 style="font-style: italic;">matplotlib</span></a>), called "<span
 style="font-style: italic;">MOP</span>" from now on.&nbsp; <span
 style="font-style: italic;">Matlab</span> is commercial while <span
 style="font-style: italic;">Octave</span> and <span
 style="font-style: italic;">Pylab</span> are free and open
source.&nbsp; <span style="font-style: italic;">Octave</span> a clone
of <span style="font-style: italic;">Matlab</span> so the same
programs will run in either.&nbsp; Programs in <i>Matlab</i> and <i>Octave</i>
(and occasionally <i>Pylab</i>) will appear on my website.&nbsp; These
can be used in homework problems and in projects. Copious resources are
available for learning <span style="font-style: italic;">Matlab/Octave/Pylab</span>.&nbsp;
See

my
modest <span style="font-style: italic;">Matlab/Octave </span>tutorial
and

links

</p>
<p><i>MOP</i> are languages designed to do numerical analysis
coursework.&nbsp; Mathematical and graphical inputs and outputs are
easily manipulated.&nbsp; Matrices appearing in problems can be easily
analyzed.&nbsp; Many of the operations appearing in numerical problems
are natural and quick in <i>MOP</i>, and require much more work in
compiled languages like <i>C</i> or <i>FORTRAN</i>.&nbsp; Even
established compiled-language programmers will find it a desirable
prototyping tool.</p>
<p>Students with <i>no</i> programming experience, or fear of fiddling
around at a command line, will have a harder time.&nbsp; The
programming experienced in Math 310 is sufficient as preparation,
however, as is any computer science programming course.&nbsp; Students
who are well-established and secure in programming are encouraged to
learn both <span style="font-style: italic;">Matlab/Octave</span> and <span
 style="font-style: italic;">Pylab</span>.&nbsp; Other compiled
languages (e.g. <span style="font-style: italic;">C</span> and <span
 style="font-style: italic;">FORTRAN</span>) could be used but at very
significant disadvantage; the programs are longer and harder to
understand.<br>
