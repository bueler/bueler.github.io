Apparently if you live in Alaska you eventually get a bear story.<br>
This is an account of killing a grizzly bear in self defense on the North<br>
Slope on Sunday August 18, 2013.&nbsp; I don't hunt grizzlies and have never had<br>
a bad bear encounter despite a lot of camping in bear country, both in 15<br>
years in Alaska and elsewhere.<br>

<br>
On Friday August 15 my family, wife Jill and kids Thomas (11 years) and Vera<br>
(9 years) drove up from Fairbanks to my favorite pull-off on the Dalton<br>
highway, with the plan to get one caribou as usual.&nbsp; This was my eleventh trip<br>
up the Dalton to get a caribou.&nbsp; I have done it almost every year in late<br>
August.&nbsp; The plan that works well for me is to hike five miles from the<br>
highway to an area which I know, by GPS and map, is outside the Dalton highway<br>
corridor and which has great views for looking for animals.&nbsp; Then I try to get<br>
a caribou with my rifle, a 308.&nbsp; This was the first time the kids came hunting<br>
with me.&nbsp; We know they are strong enough to hike over five miles of tundra.<br>
They can carry all of their own gear and a bit of the shared camp stuff.<br>
<br>
On Friday night we slept at the truck and Saturday morning we hiked in.&nbsp; With<br>
five hours hiking we got to camp about 2 pm.&nbsp; Our camp was on a small level<br>
hard-tundra spot on the west part of the ridge of "Slope Mountain" at UTM 06 W<br>
0407281 E 7627083 N, which equals 68 degrees 44' 23.46" N latitude and<br>
149 degrees 17' 30.14" W longitude.&nbsp; I camped at the same spot last year.<br>
<br>
Saturday afternoon, as planned I hiked away from the camp and looked for<br>
caribou without seeing any.&nbsp; Jill and the kids stayed in camp.&nbsp; All during our<br>
trip the temps were in the 35-45 degree range with frequent rain and wind, and<br>
constant fog and clouds.&nbsp; That evening we were already wet, but the tent worked<br>
and the inside stuff was basically dry.&nbsp; Sunday morning, after more rain<br>
in the night, we had more fog.&nbsp; It made no sense to hunt then but we hoped<br>
for better weather.&nbsp; It did not come.&nbsp; Sunday evening we had dinner and decided<br>
we would hike out the next (Monday) morning because the kids had a first day of<br>
school on Wednesday, and we needed time to drive home and clean up.&nbsp; By that<br>
night we had been in camp for 36 hours; lots of human smells (pee all around<br>
camp).&nbsp; Our food stayed away from the tent, neatly in bags under the two<br>
plastic sleds we had for hauling out meat, so as to not get too wet in the rain.<br>
We had mostly freeze-dried food, along with candy bars and such.&nbsp; A single<br>
unopened salami was the only meat, and there was a double-bagged hunk of cheese<br>
too.<br>
<br>
At about 10 pm we were in the tent and kids were going to sleep.&nbsp; We were<br>
reading James Herriott's <span style="font-style: italic;">All Creatures Great and Small</span> out loud.&nbsp; I heard scraping<br>
around our food/sleds and climbed out of the tent in underwear and socks<br>
and there was a smallish grizzly---of course it looked big.&nbsp; It looked like a black<br>
(cinnamon) bear the way young grizzlies do---and it was trying to get<br>
to the food.&nbsp; Of course on the treeless North Slope there are no black bears.<br>
All this went quickly through my head as other things were going on.<br>
<br>
I fumbled with the rifle while yelling for the bear to go away.&nbsp; It was 30 to<br>
50 feet away (10 to 20 strides, perhaps).&nbsp; The bear responded by looking up<br>
at me, slowly walking to the side to get around downwind and putting itself<br>
just as close to me and on the other side of the tent with everyone in it.<br>
But in 15 or 30 seconds it turned around and headed back to the food/sleds and<br>
climbed on top and tried to tear through the sled and to the food underneath.<br>
It was facing me the whole time, and I was yelling the whole time, and by now<br>
Jill was out of the tent with the bear spray ready and she was also yelling.<br>
I was pointing the rifle at it of course.&nbsp; It made no charge at us, but this<br>
bear had clearly established that it knew we were there, knew we were human,<br>
had food, and that the situation was fine with it and it was going to stay<br>
close to us and eat our food.<br>
<br>
The wind was mostly sideways to the line between where me and Jill were and<br>
where the bear was, but, because of the ridge location, there were gusts<br>
blowing around constantly.&nbsp; (This made lighting the stove hard, for example.)<br>
Bear spray would not have reached the bear unless we approached, and in any<br>
case it would have blown all over the camp area.&nbsp; We were beside the tent with<br>
the terrified kids inside, and we were scared of this fearless bear.&nbsp; I said<br>
to Jill that I thought I should kill it and I thought I could.&nbsp; All this time<br>
we are yelling "we are people ... go away bear ..." etc.&nbsp; But it just stayed<br>
on the sleds and tried to get through to the food; it never realized it could<br>
toss the sleds off and get to the nylon bags underneath.&nbsp; I sat down in a<br>
sitting shooting position, put the scope on lowest power, and saw that its<br>
head filled the scope anyway.&nbsp; Still yelling for it to go away.&nbsp; Then I shot<br>
once into its forehead and it slumped but remained upright on the sled and so<br>
I shot again into its skull from the side.&nbsp; Then it toppled over dead.<br>
After 30 seconds it twitched some more, as I slowly approached it, so I shot<br>
it in the head again.<br>
<br>

<br>
We spent some time shaking from the adrenaline and cold.&nbsp; We reassured the kids<br>
everything was o.k.&nbsp; I put on appropriate clothing.&nbsp; Jill and I talked and I<br>
started doing what I generally knew was needed, namely to salvage the bear.<br>
We cleaned up the food a bit; the sled bottoms were covered in blood and broken<br>
but the food was still mostly untouched.&nbsp; Jill looked at her watch and it was<br>
10:45.<br>
<br>
I started to skin the bear.&nbsp; It is different from a caribou and I did not see<br>
how to keep the pads and claws and nose on the hide so I cut off those things<br>
and threw them away.&nbsp; The bear was male, in the 150 lb range only, and might<br>
have been a year or two old though I am no expert.&nbsp; When I got the hide off in<br>
one piece (about 1.5 hours of work for me, doing a not very good job and not<br>
knowing what to do) I gutted it.&nbsp; Like a caribou and unlike a salmon, there is<br>
very little smell.&nbsp; Except that its gut was filled with blueberries and it<br>
smelled like making blueberry jam.&nbsp; The stomach was packed with more or less<br>
fresh berries and grass; no obvious human food.&nbsp; Once the guts were out and<br>
the hide off the meat cooled to outdoor (i.e. refrigerator) temperature quickly.<br>
I was tired, it was 1 am, and I went to bed.<br>
<br>
During the night I actually did sleep a bit.&nbsp; But every time I awoke Vera and<br>
Thomas were already awake and wide-eyed.&nbsp; I don't think the poor kids got much<br>
sleep at all.&nbsp; I think Jill slept a bit.<br>
<br>

<br>
In the morning the weather wasn't much better but we did need to leave.&nbsp; At<br>
least you can keep an eye out while making breakfast and such.&nbsp; Another two<br>
hours of work on the bear and I had all the meat in game bags. The front and rear<br>
legs were salvaged, and the meat along the backbone.&nbsp; Only the meatless spine was<br>
left behind.&nbsp; I recalled vaguely that I was supposed to keep the skull (unlike caribou)<br>
but it was a mess; I cut off the upper and lower jaw and put those in the game bag too.<br>
The sleds were packed and everyone fed and the kids helped pack up the sleeping<br>
bags and pads.&nbsp; The hardest thing that day was getting going.<br>
<br>

<br>
The kids did a fantastic job hiking out.&nbsp; Jill and the kids traded off pulling<br>
the wet 15 lb hide in one sled while I had the meat in the other.&nbsp; There were<br>
three stream crossings.&nbsp; At the biggest the water was higher than on the way in<br>
and we all had to wade across.&nbsp; All this time we had cold wet feet.&nbsp; Then it<br>
snowed a bit.&nbsp; Pulling sleds across wet hummocky tundra is work.<br>
<br>

<br>
On the way out we saw, in the distance, the only other hunters in the area also<br>
hiking out.&nbsp; We met them on the way in; they are friends of Christina, the<br>
friend who was house- and dogsitting while we were out of town.&nbsp; I thought<br>
"I wonder if they saw a bear".&nbsp; But they were lightly-loaded and moving fast<br>
and we didn't meet up or talk.<br>
<br>

<br>
After about 7 hours we were at the car and very happy to be there.&nbsp; Ten minutes<br>
later Wildlife Trooper Bump showed up, I assume just on his usual checks on bow<br>
hunters along the Dalton, of which there were many.&nbsp; I immediately told him what<br>
happened.&nbsp; After taking a basic report he told us to check with State Trooper<br>
Sgt Rodgers in Fairbanks, and to drive safe on the way home.&nbsp; Then our friends<br>
David Maxwell and Heidi show up in the next car that stops.&nbsp; (Yes, Alaska is a<br>
small world.)&nbsp; After talking, eating, and changing clothes we drove back to<br>
Coldfoot across a snowy Atigun Pass.&nbsp; Splurged: ate giant meal and then got the<br>
least impressive hotel room in the US that you can buy for $200 per night.&nbsp; Drove<br>
home the next day.<br>
<br>

When we got back to the house and met Christina, knowing her friends had gotten<br>
back already, I asked her: "Did your friend by any chance have a bear story?"<br>
And the answer was yes; a young bear fearlessly approached them as they were<br>
out searching for caribou.&nbsp; I am pretty sure it was the same bear.<br>

<br>
Sgt Rodgers and the wildlife tech I met at Fish and Game, where I took the bear,<br>
were helpful and understanding.&nbsp; I had not realized that, not only did I not<br>
have a permit to go bear hunting, also the season had not started for bear<br>
there.&nbsp; (So taking a permit would not have "fixed" the decision to shoot.)<br>
I filled out a Defense of Life and Property form, including a draft of this<br>
account.<br>
<br>
What should we have done better?&nbsp; In the miserable wet conditions the choice to<br>
have all food, and eat, 100 m away would have meant getting wetter and colder.<br>
We weren't cooking in the vestibule, as I think many people would.&nbsp; Having<br>
a bear canister is a good thing, but that would have been about three of them<br>
to hold four peoples food for five days; no I still wouldn't carry the weight<br>
to do that.&nbsp; Bear spray is a good thing---I know the statistics are good<br>
compared to firearms in the charging-bear situation.&nbsp; But bear spray in a small<br>
camp with many people and gusting winds is a terrifying thought; we could end<br>
up disabled with an angry bear among us.&nbsp; This bear was shot because we were<br>
certain that it was not afraid of us, that it had clearly decided to stay in our<br>
space, and that it was eating our food that we actually needed.&nbsp; Jill and I<br>
decided we would do the same thing again in these circumstances.<br>
