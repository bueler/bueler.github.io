  <h2>Ed's climbing lists</h2>
<br>

I have recently found old paper lists, one from 1988 and one from 1997, of my climbing history.  As much as anything, this helps me remember who I climbed with and when.  My most frequent partner was my Daddy (Bill Bueler = "D" in these lists), who died in 2004.  Others in my family have short designations too: "M"=Mommy, "K"=Katherine, "TE" = Tim Eaton, "J" = Jill:

Good projects: update these lists with the little bit of climbing since 2001; do OCR on 1997 list and integrate; keep track of CO fourteeners cause I am here in CO.
