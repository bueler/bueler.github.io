<p>Multilayered artificial neural networks, and other styles of machine learning, are now pervasive in application fields.  At the heart of this deep learning revolution are familiar concepts from mathematics, starting with calculus, linear algebra, optimization.</p>

<p>This seminar will be a participant-driven exploration of machine learning, including any related topics of interest, not limited to neural networks.  We will <em>start</em> from the basic ideas that underlie neural networks from an applied mathematics perspective, and branch out from there.</p>

<p>We hope to include any interested students and faculty from across UAF.  The goal is for the mathematics to be at the introductory graduate level, or the advanced undergraduate level, and for the topics to be as broad as desired.  Any related, compelling application of mathematics is fair game!</p>

<p>Topics from statistics and computer science are welcome, but they might be covered elsewhere, e.g. in STAT 621 Nonparametric Statistics and CS 605 Artificial Intelligence graduate courses.</p>

<p>To get started, the organizer expects to give a couple of talks from the introductory review article by Higham & Higham, the first resource listed below:  <em>What is a deep neural network?  How is one trained?  What is the stochastic gradient method?  How is training related to least-squares problems?</em></p>

<p><b>Resources:</b>  One goal of the seminar will be to identify and collect some <em>open</em> resources.  Here are some to start:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Higham, C. F., & Higham, D. J. (2019). <a href="http://www.math.stonybrook.edu/~bishop/classes/math533.S21/MachineLearning/SIAMreview.pdf"><em>Deep learning: An introduction for applied mathematicians.</em></a> SIAM Review, 61(4), 860-891.</li>
  <li>M. P. Deisenroth, A. A. Faisal, and C. S. Ong, <a href="https://mml-book.github.io/"><em>Mathematics for Machine Learning</em></a>, Cambridge University Press 2020.</li>
  <li>Sun, S., Cao, Z., Zhu, H., & Zhao, J. (2019). <a href="https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8903465"><em>A survey of optimization methods from a machine learning perspective.</em></a> IEEE Transactions on Cybernetics, 50(8), 3668-3681.
  <li>Bottou, L., Curtis, F. E., & Nocedal, J. (2018). <a href="https://research.fb.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/sirev60-2_223.pdf"><em>Optimization methods for large-scale machine learning.</em></a> SIAM Review, 60(2), 223-311. &nbsp; <a href="https://math.gmu.edu/~hantil/ECOM/2021/2021_ecom_tut_curtis-1-29.pdf">Additional slides.</a></li>
  </li>
</ul>

<p><b>Credit:&nbsp;</b> Students who expect to earn 1.0 credits for this seminar should plan to give at least 2 (casual!) one-hour talks in the seminar.  Everyone else is welcome to receive 0.0 credits under any conditions!</p>

<p><b>Prerequisites:&nbsp;</b> Graduate standing or permission of instructor.</p>
