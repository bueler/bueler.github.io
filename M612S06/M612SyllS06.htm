<b><font size="+1">Description:</font></b>&nbsp; Mathematical
methods for graduate-level physics.&nbsp; In MATH/PHYS 612 we will
study complex analysis (including conformal mapping), eigenfunction
expansions, Hermitian
operators, Sturm-Liouville problems, some group theory, vector and
tensor fields (if
possible), and the calculus of
variations (if possible).<br>
<p>The course does not teach physics except tangentially.&nbsp; Many
"mathematical physics" courses nationwide are narrowly focussed on the
mathematical needs of quantum mechanics, quantum field theory, and/or
general relativity.&nbsp; The
typical UAF student's needs are broader (and sometimes
shallower), frequently including geophysics.&nbsp; Many UAF graduate
students in math and
physics will work with systems of nonlinear PDEs or other nonlinear
models.&nbsp; Therefore this
course emphasizes general strategies and
mathematical possibilities.<br>
</p>
<p><b><font size="+1">Course Format:</font></b>&nbsp; The majority of
class time will consist of my lecture.&nbsp; I will encourage as
many on-the-topic questions as possible.&nbsp; Weekly homework
assignments should inspire questions as well. Students should come to
my office, individually and in groups, to discuss
problems from the class.&nbsp; I also encourage students to talk to me
about mathematical issues which arise in the context of a
project/thesis/dissertation. </p>

This thick and imperfect textbook has 28 chapters, only a subset of
which are at the right level for 611-612.&nbsp; In 612 my goal is to
cover chapters 20, 17, 18, 19, and 24 (and possibly 21 and 22) in this
order.&nbsp;
Some supplementary material will be added from other sources.<br>

. &nbsp;You are covered by the UAF Honor Code.&nbsp; I will work with
the Office of Disabilities Services (203 WHIT, 474-7043) to provide
reasonable accommodation to student with disabilities.<br>
