<br>
<b><big>Course Content and Goals:</big></b>&nbsp;&nbsp; The content of
the course is cleanly summarized in the UAF Catalog: "Completeness of
the real numbers and its consequences: convergence of
sequences and series, limits and continuity, differentiation, and the
Riemann integral."<br>
<br>
Real analysis is a major milestone in the development of mathematics.&nbsp; It was
built in the 19th century as the rigorous underpinning of the 17th
century calculus, which was useful but suspect when examined closely.<br>
<br>
Real analysis is a core discipline in modern mathematics,
and central to a student's maturing understanding of mathematics.&nbsp; It is
essential for much of applied mathematics including differential
equations, approximation theory, fluid dynamics, and quantum
physics.&nbsp; It is a major part of 20th century pure mathematics
including functional analysis, differential geometry, and stochastic
processes.<br>
<br>
<b><big>Outcomes:</big></b>&nbsp; From my point of view this course is key preparation for teaching calculus.&nbsp; Many math majors do
that job, whether in high schools, community colleges, or
universities.&nbsp; Regardless of the level, teaching calculus requires
you have a coherent thread to follow, and that thread is the clear
understanding of the limit process(es) in calculus.&nbsp; Just being
able to work problems in calculus, which is a skill you should have
already, does not suffice.&nbsp; On the other hand, all further work in
mathematics, whether the goal is to understand 20th century mathematics
or to create new 21st century mathematics, assumes a rigorous basis in
things like convergent sequences and precise definitions of
derivatives and integrals.<b><big><br>

Based on your raw homework and exam scores, I guarantee grades
according to the following schedule: 90 - 100 % = <b>A</b>, 79 - 89 %
= <b>B</b>,
68 - 78 % = <b>C</b>, 57 - 67 % = <b>D</b>, 0 - 56 % = <b>F</b>.&nbsp;
I
reserve the right to increase your grade above this schedule based on
the
actual difficulty of the work and on average class performance.<br>
<br>
<big><span style="font-weight: bold;">The "W" designator, draft/re-draft of some homework, and LaTeX too:</span></big>&nbsp;
This will indeed be a writing-intensive course.&nbsp; Almost every problem will be a proof, and I'll grade the
quality of the writing on every
problem.&nbsp; This includes complete sentences, correct grammar,
and appropriate writing style for the mathematical discipline.<br>
<br>
On each homework assignment I will also circle one problem which will
involve even more focus on both writing and mathematical quality.&nbsp;
Each student will have a different problem circled.&nbsp; For that
circled problem you will be required to write a LaTeX solution and
submit it electronically.&nbsp; You may LaTeX all your homework, but I
want all problems submitted on paper, with your circled problem also
submitted electronically.&nbsp; I will grade your LaTeXed solution and
return it with comments, both on the mathematical correctness and the
writing.&nbsp; You'll resubmit the corrected version on paper.&nbsp; (<span style="font-style: italic;">The
first assignment will be an exception.&nbsp; On A#1 everyone will LaTeX
the same problem based on a known proof, just for practice.</span>)<br>
<br>
<big><b>Policies:</b></big>&nbsp;&nbsp; The Dept of Mathematics
and Statistics has reasonable policies on incompletes, late
withdrawals, early final examinations, etc.; see <a href="http://www.uaf.edu/dms/policies/">www.uaf.edu/dms/policies/</a>.
&nbsp;You
are covered by the UAF Student Code of
Conduct.&nbsp;
I will work with
the Office of Disabilities Services (208 WHIT, 474-5655) to provide
reasonable accommodation to student with disabilities.<br>
