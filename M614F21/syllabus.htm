Trefethen &amp; Bau, <em>Numerical Linear Algebra</em>, SIAM Press 1997

<h3 style="text-align:left;"> Course Website: </h3>

<a href="index.html">bueler.github.io/M614F21/</a><br><br>

This site has a daily schedule of topics, due dates, links to assignments, links to Matlab examples and solutions, and other helpful content.  It will be updated on an ongoing basis to reflect what topics were actually covered.

<h3 style="text-align:left;"> Course Content: </h3>

This course covers how actual matrices and vectors of any (finite) dimension are handled in a fast and accurate manner on computers.  This is essential technology for scientific and engineering computation.<br><br>

Numerical linear algebra will be placed in the correct mathematical framework, emphasizing the geometry of the matrix action.  We will cover famous matrix decompositions, theorems, and algorithms: singular value decomposition (SVD), Householder reflections, LU decomposition, spectral theorem, Schur decomposition, the QR method for eigenvalues, and Krylov methods.  Additionally, the conditioning of problems and the stability of algorithms are central themes.<br> <br>

Applications of these ideas include solving large linear systems, solving systems of ordinary differential equations, statistical methods, inverse methods in geophysics, and Markov processes.  Furthermore, numerical linear algebra is key for solving partial differential equations, network problems, and optimization problems, and it is an underlying theory in machine learning.<br> <br>

Examples in class and homework problems will routinely use Matlab.  (Or Octave, Python, or Julia, all of which are well-suited to numerical linear algebra.  Students already comfortable with these are free to use them, but I will help students learn how to use Matlab and Octave in particular.)  Student competence with scientific computing languages is a goal of the course.

<h3 style="text-align:left;">Topics:</h3>

<ul>
  <li>matrix/vector mechanics</li>
  <li>geometric view of linear algebra</li>
  <li>singular value decomposition<br>
  </li>
  <li>QR factorization and least squares</li>
  <li>conditioning and stability</li>
  <li>operation count and algorithmic complexity<br>
  </li>
  <li>systems of equations and Gaussian elimination<br>
</li>
  <li>computing eigenvalues</li>
  <li>iterative methods</li>
</ul>

<h3 style="text-align:left;">Outcomes:</h3>

At the end of this course you will be
able to understand and apply the ideas and algorithms of numerical
linear algebra.&nbsp; You will be very comfortable with Matlab or a similar scientific computing language.<br>

<h3 style="text-align:left;">Evaluation and Grading:</h3>

Weekly homework dominates your grade.  The homework will include by-hand computations, proofs, and Matlab computations.  There will also be a <span style="font-weight: bold;">1/2 hour proctored quarterterm quiz</span> and a <span style="font-weight: bold;">one hour proctored midterm exam</span>.  These assessments will emphasize definitions and basic manipulations.  At the end of the course there will be a <span style="font-weight: bold;">take-home
final exam</span> emphasizing proofs and nontrivial
calculations/applications.<br>

Based on your raw homework and exam scores, I guarantee grades
according to the following schedule: 90 - 100 % = <b>A</b>, 79 - 89 %
= <b>B</b>,
68 - 78 % = <b>C</b>, 57 - 67 % = <b>D</b>, 0 - 56 % = <b>F</b>.&nbsp;
I
reserve the right to increase your grade above this schedule based on
the
actual difficulty of the work and on average class performance.<br>

<h3 style="text-align:left;"> Prerequisites </h3>

In summary, the prerequisites are undergraduate linear algebra and mathematical maturity.  Officially: <span style="font-style: italic;">MATH 314 Linear Algebra or equivalent. Recommended: MATH 421 Applied Analysis OR MATH 401 Introduction to Real Analysis OR equivalent post-calculus course in analysis.</span>

<h3 style="text-align:left;"> Policies </h3>

The Dept of Mathematics and Statistics has reasonable policies on incompletes, late withdrawals, early final examinations, etc.; see <a href="http://www.uaf.edu/dms/policies/">www.uaf.edu/dms/policies</a>.  You are covered by the UAF Student Code of Conduct.   UA is an AA/EO employer and educational institution and prohibits illegal discrimination against any individual: <a href="https://alaska.edu/nondiscrimination">alaska.edu/nondiscrimination</a>.   I will work with the Office of Disabilities Services (208 WHIT, 474-5655) to provide reasonable accommodation to students with disabilities.<br>

<h3 style="text-align:left;"> Student Protections Statement </h3>
