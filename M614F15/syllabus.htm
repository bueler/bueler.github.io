<h2 style="text-align:left;"> Course Content and Goals: </h2>

This course covers how actual matrices and vectors are handled in a fast and accurate manner.  This essential technology for scientific and engineering computation will be placed in the correct framework, emphasizing the geometry of the matrix action.  Central themes are the conditioning of problems and the stability of algorithms.  We will cover famous matrix decompositions, theorems, and algorithms: singular value decomposition (SVD), LU decomposition, spectral theorem, Schur decomposition, the QR method for eigenvalues, and Krylov methods.<br> <br>

Applications of these ideas include solving large linear systems, solving systems of ordinary differential equations, statistical methods, inverse methods in geophysics, and Markov processes.  Numerical linear algebra is key for numerically solving partial differential equations, network problems, and optimization problems.<br> <br>

Examples in class will often use Matlab/Octave.  (Or python+scipy=pylab for students who are already comfortable with python.)  I will help students learn how to use one of these tools, all of which are well-suited to numerical linear algebra.  Student competence with such a language, for scientific computing though not necessarily general computer programming, is a goal of the course.<br>

<h2 style="text-align:left;">Topics:</h2>

<ul>
  <li>matrix/vector mechanics</li>
  <li>geometric view of linear algebra</li>
  <li>singular value decomposition<br>
  </li>
  <li>QR factorization and least squares</li>
  <li>conditioning and stability</li>
  <li>operation count and problem size<br>
  </li>
  <li>systems of equations and Gaussian elimination<br>
</li>
  <li>computing eigenvalues</li>
  <li>iterative methods</li>
</ul>

<h2 style="text-align:left;">Outcomes:</h2>

At the end of this course you will be
able to understand and apply the ideas and algorithms of numerical
linear algebra.&nbsp; You will be very comfortable with Matlab or a similar language.<br>


<h2 style="text-align:left;">Assigned Work, Evaluation, and Grading:</h2>

Weekly homework dominates your grade.  The homework will include by-hand computations, proofs, and Matlab/Octave
computations.  There will also be a <span style="font-weight: bold;">one
hour in-class midterm exam</span>, emphasizing definitions
and basic manipulations, and a <span style="font-weight: bold;">take-home
final exam</span> emphasizing proofs and nontrivial
calculations/applications.<br>

<br>
Based on your raw homework and exam scores, I guarantee grades
according to the following schedule: 90 - 100 % = <b>A</b>, 79 - 89 %
= <b>B</b>,
68 - 78 % = <b>C</b>, 57 - 67 % = <b>D</b>, 0 - 56 % = <b>F</b>.&nbsp;
I
reserve the right to increase your grade above this schedule based on
the
actual difficulty of the work and on average class performance.<br>


<h2 style="text-align:left;">Policies:</h2>

The Dept of Mathematics
and Statistics has reasonable policies on incompletes, late
withdrawals, early final examinations, etc.; see <a href="http://www.uaf.edu/dms/policies/">www.uaf.edu/dms/policies</a>.
&nbsp;You
are covered by the UAF Student Code of
Conduct.&nbsp;
I will work with
the Office of Disabilities Services (208 WHIT, 474-5655) to provide
reasonable accommodation to student with disabilities.<br>


<h2 style="text-align:left;"> Prerequisites:</h2>
