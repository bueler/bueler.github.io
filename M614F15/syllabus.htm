<h2 style="text-align:left;"> Course Content and Goals: </h2>

This course will describe
how
actual matrices and vectors can be handled in a stable, fast, and
accurate manner.&nbsp; This is key technology for scientific and
engineering computation.&nbsp; We
will
place these topics in the correct framework, emphasizing the geometry
of the action of
matrices.&nbsp; We will cover some famous matrix
decompositions,
theorems, and algorithms: singular
value decomposition (SVD), LU decomposition, spectral theorem, Schur
decomposition,
the QR method for eigenvalues, and Krylov
methods.&nbsp; Applications of these ideas include solving large linear
systems, solving systems of
ordinary differential equations, statistical methods, inverse methods
in geophysics, and Markov processes.&nbsp; Numerical linear
algebra is key for numerically solving
partial differential equations and many large graph problems.<br>
<br>
Examples in class will often use Matlab/Octave.&nbsp; (Or
python---scipy/pylab---for students who are already comfortable with
python.)&nbsp;
I will help students learn how to use one of these
tools, all of which are well-suited to numerical linear algebra.&nbsp;
Student competence with such a language, for scientific computing though not necessarily general programming, is a
goal of the course.<br>
<br>

<h2 style="text-align:left;">Topic list:</h2>

<ul>
  <li>matrix/vector mechanics</li>
  <li>geometric view of linear algebra</li>
  <li>singular value decomposition<br>
  </li>
  <li>QR factorization and least squares</li>
  <li>conditioning and stability</li>
  <li>operation count and problem size<br>
  </li>
  <li>systems of equations and Gaussian elimination<br>
</li>
  <li>computing eigenvalues</li>
  <li>iterative methods</li>
</ul>

<h2 style="text-align:left;">Outcomes:</h2>

At the end of this course you will be
able to understand and apply the ideas and algorithms of numerical
linear algebra.&nbsp; You will be very comfortable with Matlab or a similar language.<br>
<br>

<h2 style="text-align:left;">Assigned Work and Evaluation and Grade:</h2>

Weekly
homework will include by-hand computations, proofs, and Matlab/Octave
computations.&nbsp; There will be a short project in which you are
asked to find and explain/explore an application of numerical linear
algebra.&nbsp; There will be a <span style="font-weight: bold;">one
hour in-class midterm exam</span>, emphasizing definitions
and basic manipulations, and a <span style="font-weight: bold;">take-home
final
exam</span> emphasizing proofs and nontrivial
calculations/applications.<br>

<br>
Based on your raw homework and exam scores, I guarantee grades
according to the following schedule: 90 - 100 % = <b>A</b>, 79 - 89 %
= <b>B</b>,
68 - 78 % = <b>C</b>, 57 - 67 % = <b>D</b>, 0 - 56 % = <b>F</b>.&nbsp;
I
reserve the right to increase your grade above this schedule based on
the
actual difficulty of the work and on average class performance.<br>
<br>

<h2 style="text-align:left;">Policies:</h2>

The Dept of Mathematics
and Statistics has reasonable policies on incompletes, late
withdrawals, early final examinations, etc.; see <a href="http://www.dms.uaf.edu/dms/Policies.html">www.dms.uaf.edu/dms/Policies.html</a>.
&nbsp;You
are covered by the UAF Student Code of
Conduct.&nbsp;
I will work with
the Office of Disabilities Services (208 WHIT, 474-5655) to provide
reasonable accommodation to student with disabilities.<br>
<br>
