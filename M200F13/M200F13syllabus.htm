<big><b>The Course and Lectures:</b></big>&nbsp;&nbsp; This course
covers the basics of single variable calculus.&nbsp; You will learn the
meaning of, and basic manipulations of, the three
fundamental operations in calculus: (i) limits, (ii)
differentiation, (iii) integration.&nbsp; Differentiation and
integration are limits.<br>
<br>
Calculus is the
language of physics and engineering, and much of
chemistry, economics, and biology.&nbsp; In these fields there is both <span style="font-style: italic;">continuous</span> and <span style="font-style: italic;">discrete</span>
mathematics.&nbsp; Calculus is the core theory of continuous mathematics.&nbsp;
For example,
position and energy in mechanics, the velocity of a fluid, magnetic
field strength, and probabilities in brownian motion all involve
continuous
quantities described using calculus.&nbsp; People do also use calculus
to approximately describe things that are actually discrete, like
populations or votes or
the numbers of molecules in a chemical process.<br>
<br>
The textbook is
the <span style="font-style: italic;">Early Transcendental Functions</span> 5th edition of Larson &amp; Edwards, <i>Calculus</i>.&nbsp; We will cover chapters 1 (review of functions), 2 (limits), 3
(derivatives), 4 (applications of differentiation), and 5
(integrals).<br>
<br>On Monday, Tuesday, Wednesday, and Friday you will see me and I
will be either lecturing on new material, answering your questions,
asking you questions, or doing exams (see below for dates).&nbsp; You
are expected to ask questions in class
about the lecture or about homework assignments.&nbsp; Such questions
are a
<span style="font-style: italic;">great</span> use of the class' time! You are unlikely to be the only one with
a given question, so please do ask.<br>
<br>
<big><b>"Recitation" sections:</b></big>&nbsp;&nbsp; An important part
of Math 200 at UAF is an
additional hour every week in a small "recitation" section.&nbsp; <span style="font-style: italic;">So this is a 5-day-a-week class!</span>&nbsp; This section
is designed to help as many
students as possible succeed at learning the calculus.&nbsp; The
sections are on Thursday, at one of three times:<br>&nbsp; F07 (CRN 76561)&nbsp; =&nbsp; 9:45-10:45 &nbsp;&nbsp; Gruening 303<br>&nbsp; F08 (CRN 76562)&nbsp; =&nbsp; 11:30-12:30&nbsp; Brooks 104A<br>&nbsp; F09 (CRN 76563)&nbsp; =&nbsp; 8:00-9:00 &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; Chapman 104<br><br>
In these sections the main goal
is to discuss, with
a person other than me, the homework
and questions which arose in lecture.&nbsp; There will also be required
quizzes in these sections.&nbsp; Attendance at sections is mandatory.&nbsp; The teaching assistant Vikenty Mikheev, a
graduate student in mathematics, is fully able to answer your calculus
questions.<br>
<br>
<span style="font-weight: bold;"><big>WebAssign:</big></span>&nbsp;&nbsp; Please go to <a href="http://webassign.net/">http://webassign.net</a> right away and log in. &nbsp;  To get started, hit the "I have a class key" button and enter &nbsp; &nbsp;  <span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-family: monospace; font-size: 19px; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; font-weight: bold; letter-spacing: normal; line-height: normal; orphans: 2; text-align: start; text-indent: 0px; text-transform: none; white-space: normal; widows: 2; word-spacing: 0px; background-color: rgb(255, 255, 255); display: inline ! important; float: none;">uaf 3303 9761</span>&nbsp; &nbsp; You'll then establish a username and you will enter your "access
code" which you got with your textbook.<br>
<br>
Not-for-credit "WebAssignments" will be available each week.&nbsp; <span style="font-style: italic;">I encourage you to do a part of this every class day</span>.&nbsp;
You'll do the problems and
submit your answers and they will be graded.&nbsp; On the second
submission you'll see the answers.&nbsp; <span style="font-weight: bold;">I will not use
your WebAssignment score in determining your grade.</span>&nbsp; You are <span style="font-style: italic;"></span>encouraged to work with other students on WebAssignments. <br>
<br>
<b><big>Exams, quizzes, and paper homework determine your course grade:</big> <br>
<br>
60%</b> of
your grade will be determined by&nbsp; <b>four hours of exams:</b>

<br>
<span style="font-weight: bold;">20%</span> of the course grade will be
determined by <span style="font-weight: bold;">weekly quizzes</span>.&nbsp;
(Exception: on weeks where there are midterm exams there will not be a quiz.)&nbsp; These
will be given in the first 20 minutes of your Thursday section.&nbsp;
Solutions will be handed out immediately and are a great topic for
discussion.&nbsp; These quizzes are also intended to help you with Exams by
giving you an opportunity to see the kinds of questions which arise
on exams, and my style in writing them.&nbsp; I will drop your lowest
quiz score.<br>
<br>
<b>20% </b>of the total grade will be determined by
<b>weekly written (paper) homework</b>.&nbsp;&nbsp; These will
be short, just a few problems, but they are likely to be the hardest
problems I ask.&nbsp; You are encouraged to work with other students on
this paper homework.&nbsp; I
will announce each assignment in lecture and post the due date at the <a href="Math200F13.htm">course web site</a>.&nbsp; Late paper homework is not accepted.&nbsp; I will drop your lowest paper homework score.<br>
<br>
<big><span style="font-weight: bold;">Preparing for exams</span></big>: I encourage
you to construct practice problems by "role-playing" <span style="font-style: italic;">me</span>
before each exam.&nbsp; That is:&nbsp; Assume that I am a
reasonable
person who wants to test whether you comprehend what was
lectured on and assigned.&nbsp; Assume I have
the goal of covering the topics and asking
questions which represent a reasonable range of difficulty.&nbsp; What questions
would I
ask?&nbsp; If you do this role-playing then you will be able to
generate a very close approximation of the exam I will give.&nbsp; And you will get a good grade.<br>

<b><font size="+1"><br>
Prerequisites:</font></b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The official policy is
"a grade of C or better in MATH 107X and 108 or placement for MATH 200X."&nbsp; In the
latter case, you can be placed in MATH 200 if you have certain scores
on exams: 28 on Enhanced ACT Math <span style="font-weight: bold;">or</span>
640 on SAT Math <span style="font-weight: bold;">or</span> (56 on
COMPASS College Algebra <span style="font-weight: bold;">and</span> 46
on COMPASS Trigonometry) <span style="font-weight: bold;">or</span> 90 on Accuplacer College Math.&nbsp; As a <span style="font-style: italic;">practical
</span>matter you must have
taken a precalculus class, have covered trigonometry at the precalculus level, and you
must have done reasonably well.&nbsp; Less than this
is, in the absence of further information, a big warning sign about success
in Calculus.<br>
<br>
<big><span style="font-weight: bold;">Placement Test in first week:</span></big>&nbsp;
There will be a short in-class Placement Test covering prerequisite
material on Monday 9
September.&nbsp; This Test will be graded and the score used to advise
you on whether you were properly placed in Calculus I.&nbsp; You are
required to take it and you will get a fixed amount of credit for
taking it regardless of your score; your score will only be used for
placement.<br>
<br>
<big><span style="font-weight: bold;">Adds, Drops, Withdrawals</span></big>:
The last day for adding a class is Friday September 13.&nbsp; The last
day for dropping a class is Friday September 20.&nbsp; The last day for
withdrawing, with a W appearing on your
transcript, is Friday November 1. If, in my opinion, a student is not
participating adequately in the class, I may elect to drop or withdraw
this student. Inadequate participation includes but is not limited to:
missing an exam, repeatedly failing to take quizzes or to complete
paper homework, or having a failing average at the withdrawal
date.&nbsp; (<span style="font-style: italic;">But I am OK with giving a D or F at the end of the semester for failing work.&nbsp; Don't count on me doing you a favor.</span>)<br>
<br>
<big><b>Policies:</b></big>&nbsp;&nbsp; The Department of Mathematics
and Statistics has reasonable policies on incompletes, late
withdrawals, early final examinations, etc. &nbsp;See <small><a href="http://www.dms.uaf.edu/dms/Policies.html">www.dms.uaf.edu/dms/Policies.html</a>
</small>. &nbsp;You are covered by the UAF Student Code of
Conduct.&nbsp; If you need course adaptations or accommodations because
of a disability, please inform your instructor during the first week of
the
semester, after consulting with the Office of Disability Services, 203
Whitaker (474-7403).<big><b><br>
<br>
Makeup exams:</b></big>&nbsp; I will create makeup versions of Midterm
Exams 1 and 2 if necessary, provided you have a convincing reason for me to do so
<span style="font-weight: bold;">and</span>
you let me know at least two class
days
before the exam.&nbsp; It is Department of Mathematics and Statistics policy that Final Exams cannot be given early or late.<br>
<br>
<big><b>Math and Stat Lab in Chapman 305:</b></big>&nbsp; Please take
advantage of &nbsp;the <big><span style="font-weight: bold;">Lab</span></big> in Chapman 305.<b>&nbsp;</b>
See reverse for draft schedule.&nbsp; This is a <span style="font-style: italic;">free </span>study room
and tutoring center which is open long hours, including on
weekends.&nbsp; It is staffed by advanced students.&nbsp;
There are computers in this room.&nbsp; If
doing
math homework gets lonely, go there to find fellow sufferers.<br>
<br>
<big><b>Other resources:</b></big>&nbsp; Individual tutoring is also
available through the ASUAF.&nbsp; The UAF Bookstore has study
guides for calculus.&nbsp; I especially like <span style="font-style: italic;">How to Ace Calculus : The Streetwise Guide</span>
