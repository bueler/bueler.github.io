<h2 style="text-align:left;"> Course Content, Topics, and Goals: </h2>

This course introduces multi-variable calculus.  The textbook is J. Stewart, <span style="font-style: italic;">Calculus</span>, 8th ed. Early Transcendentals, Cengage 2016.  We will only cover chapters 12-16.  Topics include:

<ul>
  <li>vectors,</li>
  <li>curves and surfaces,</li>
  <li>vector-valued functions,</li>
  <li>partial derivatives,</li>
  <li>gradient/divergence/curl operations,</li>
  <li>multiple integrals, and</li>
  <li>integrals along curves/surfaces/solids.</li>
</ul>

At the end of this course you should be able to apply the tools of single-variable and multi-variable calculus to problems which arise in other subjects, such as in the sciences and engineering.<br>


<h2 style="text-align:left;"> Prerequisite:</h2>

MATH F252X Calculus II.  (Former number: MATH F201X.)
<br>

<h2 style="text-align:left;"> Lectures Format: </h2>

The class meets Monday, Tuesday, Wednesday, and Friday in Gruening 412.  I am the only instructor.  There is no 5th hour with a teaching assistant, as there is in Calc I/II at UAF.<br><br>

Every day I will cover new material.  During each class I will ask you sometimes to work on problems and answer questions; sometimes I'll be using the board and sometimes you will.  You are also expected to <span style="font-style: italic;">ask</span> questions in class about the lecture or about homework assignments.  Such questions are a great use of the class' time, as you are unlikely to be the only one with a given question.  Please do ask!<br><br>

One day each week, chosen at random, I'll take attendance.  Attendance is not a part of your grade, but it correlates very strongly with student success.  I will be less sympathetic with issues arising for students who do not both coming to class.  Also, this will help me learn all your names.<br>


<h2 style="text-align:left;"> Some Homework is Online: </h2>

Please go to

<h3><a href="http://webassign.net">http://webassign.net</a></h3>

right away and log in.   To get started, click "ENTER CLASS KEY" and enter

<h3>uaf 3508 8409</h3>

Then set a username and password.  You will also enter your "access code" which you got with your textbook.<br><br>

FIXME "WebAssignments" will be due each week.  I encourage you to do a part of this every class day.  You'll do the problems and submit your answers and they will be graded.  On the second submission you'll see the answers.  I will not use your WebAssignment score in determining your grade.  You are encouraged to work with other students on WebAssignments. 
<br>


<h2 style="text-align:left;"> Other Homework is On Paper: </h2>

FIXME

<h2 style="text-align:left;">Assigned Work, Evaluation, and Grading:</h2>

The homework grade is from WebAssignments and PaperHomework.  There will be <span style="font-weight: bold;">two (hour-long) in-class Midterm Exams</span>, and a <span style="font-weight: bold;">two hour Final Exam</span>:<br>

Based on your homework and exam scores, combined according to the above fractions, I guarantee grades according to the following schedule:<br><br>

<table cols="2" width="80%">
    <tr>
      <td valign="top" width="40%"><b>Score</b></td>
      <td valign="top" width="40%"><b>Grade</b></td>

    <tr>
      <td></td>
      <td></td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>90 - 100 %</td>
      <td>A</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>79 - 89 %</td>
      <td>B</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>68 - 78 %</td>
      <td>C</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>57 - 67 %</td>
      <td>D</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>0 - 56 %</td>
      <td>F</td>
    </tr>
</table>

<br>
I reserve the right to increase your grade above this schedule based on the actual difficulty of the work and on average class performance.<br>
