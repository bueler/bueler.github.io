J. Stewart, <em>Calculus</em>, Early Transcendentals, 8th ed., Brooks-Cole 2015<br>
<br>

You will need WebAssign access.  We cover Chapters 12--16 of the book.<br>

<h3 style="text-align:left;"> Prerequisites:</h3>

Placement into MATH 253 is by passing MATH 252 with a grade of C- or better, or by earning a 4 or 5 on the BC AP Calculus exam.  Students who have not met the current placement requirements within the last two years will be dropped within the first two weeks of the course.<br>

<h3 style="text-align:left;"> Course content: </h3>

Multivariable calculus.  Topics include vectors in 2- and 3-dimensions, partial derivatives, multiple integration, and vector calculus, including Green's and Stokes' Theorem.  The content depends more on Calculus I than on Calculus II.<br>
<br>

Getting the most out of the lectures and homework is <em>your</em> responsibility.  (I will make them worth your time!)  You <em>should</em> ask questions in lecture, both about the new content and about the homework assignments.<br>

<h3 style="text-align:left;">Graded Work, and How Your Grade is Determined:</h3>

Your grade will be determined from three Exams, plus weekly Quizzes, Written Homework, and WebAssign.<br><br>

Based on the score computed using the above percentages I guarantee grades according to this schedule:<br>
<br>

<table cols="2" width="80%">

      <td valign="top" width="40%"><b>Score</b></td>
      <td valign="top" width="40%"><b>Grade</b></td>

    <tr>
      <td>90 - 100 %</td>
      <td>A</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>79 - 89 %</td>
      <td>B</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>68 - 78 %</td>
      <td>C</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>57 - 67 %</td>
      <td>D</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>0 - 56 %</td>
      <td>F</td>
    </tr>
</table>
<br>

This schedule is a lower-bound guarantee.  That is, I reserve the right to increase your grade <i>above</i> this schedule based on the actual difficulty of the work and/or upon average class performance.  I will assign plusses and minuses at my discretion.<br>
<br>

<h3 style="text-align:left;">What you do each week:</h3>

<em>Every Wednesday in the semester</em> is either a Quiz or an Exam.  The Quizzes and Exams are closed-book and closed-note.  The Quizzes will be during the last 25 minutes of the Wednesday lecture period, while the Midterm Exams will use the full hour.<br>
<br>

The Written Homework will be handed out on Mondays.  It is due on the following Monday.<br>
<br>

The WebAssignments are intended to be mostly routine problems while the Written Homework has more-interesting problems which take more time.  On the WebAssign problems you will be shown the answer and solution after two tries, and you'll have three additional tries.  Thus there is no excuse for not getting 100% on the WebAssignments.<br>
<br>


<h3 style="text-align:left;">Getting help:</h3>

Please plan to ask me many questions during the semester.  If you need more help there is the Math Lab in Chapman 305 (<a href="https://uaf.edu/dms/mathlab/math-and-stat-lab-schedul-1/">uaf.edu/dms/mathlab/math-and-stat-lab-schedul-1</a>) as well as one-on-one tutoring in Eielson 302 (<a href="https://uaf.edu/dms/mathlab/one-on-one-tutoring/">uaf.edu/dms/mathlab/one-on-one-tutoring</a>).<br>
<br>


<h3 style="text-align:left;">Policies:</h3>

The Dept of Mathematics and Statistics has reasonable policies on incompletes, late withdrawals, early final examinations, etc.; see <a href="http://www.uaf.edu/dms/policies/">www.uaf.edu/dms/policies</a>. &nbsp;  You are covered by the UAF Student Code of Conduct. &nbsp;  I will work with the Office of Disabilities Services (208 WHIT, 474-5655) to provide reasonable accommodation to student with disabilities.<br>
