<font size=+3>Graduate Seminar in Random Walks (Math 692)</font></h3></center>

<center><font color="#000000">Organizer: <b>Ed Bueler</b></font>
<br>Tentative time &amp; place:&nbsp; <b><font size=+1>Thursday 2:15--3:15&nbsp;
Chapman 107</font></b></center>

<p><b>I propose:</b> a seminar&nbsp; in random walks, which is a topic
at the intersection of
<i>probability</i>, <i>graph theory</i> and <i>analysis</i>.
<p>A random walk is a sequence of graph--valued random variables which
describe a particle moving from vertex to vertex on a graph according to
a prescribed rule.

A fundamental and typical question is: for a given random walk starting
at a certain point, what is the probability of returning eventually to
that same point?&nbsp; For a surprisingly large class of random walks this
probability is one!&nbsp; Answering this question for a given random walk
is a route to giving a <i>geometry</i> to a graph.
<p>My intention is to start by collecting a set of readings in the early
(mathematically and chronologically) theory.&nbsp; Reading, discussing,
and lecturing on these would form the first half of the course.
<h4>

<hr>Students who want 1.0 credit</h4>
should be prepared to give two (2) one--hour talks.&nbsp; Topics for such
talks can and should include:
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; (i) lectures on the content of research papers in
random walks and associated areas, and
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; (ii) descriptions of simulations of random walks
performed by the student.
<br>Graduate students in mathematics and statistics are especially encouraged
to attend.
