\thispagestyle{empty}

I have three goals in starting the course with examples:
\renewcommand{\labelenumi}{\arabic{enumi})}
\begin{enumerate}
\item To suggest how optimization can come from real-world applications.
\item To allow you to create, for yourself, some basic theoretical and numerical ideas about how to solve such problems.
\item To provide examples on which to practice and learn \Matlab\footnote{You may use other languages such as \Python or \Julia.  However, I will only provide examples and solutions in \Matlab.  Note that a \Matlab code works in \Octave and vice versa.} programming.
\end{enumerate}

The textbook\footnote{Griva, Nash, and Sofer, \emph{Linear and Nonlinear Optimization}, 2nd ed., SIAM Press 2009.  See Chapter 1.} also provides many examples.  In any case, all optimization experts have been exposed to loads of examples.  You will not be able to understand the theory and algorithms without some understanding of applications like these.

Following Chapter 2.1 in the textbook, in each example problem I will identify a \emph{feasible set} $S$ and an \emph{objective function} $f(x)$.  Each problem can be written in a standard form
    $$\min_{x\in S} f(x).$$

This document does \emph{not} address how to solve the problems.  That will be done in class, on homework, and in additional handouts; Assignment \#1 asks you to solve some.  Regarding goal 2) above, your method may be ``brute force'' and inefficient.  That is just fine for now!  The rest of the course will make more sense if you see brute force approaches before more elegant algorithms.

Each example has a name like ``\texttt{fit}.''  I will also use this name for my \Matlab code (e.g.~``\texttt{fit.m}'') when I hand out solutions.  Later Assignments will be largely based on textbook exercises, but I'll add my own problems, like these, as needed.

\bigskip
\renewcommand{\labelenumi}{\Roman{enumi}. \quad}
\begin{enumerate}
\item (\texttt{calcone})  \quad Let
    $$f(x) = \left(x^2 + \cos x\right)^2 - 10 \sin(5 x).$$
Compute the minimum of $f$ on the interval $S=[0,2]$:
    $$\min_{x\in [0,2]} f(x)$$

You saw such problems in Calculus I, but this one is hard to do by hand.  It benefits from computer visualization, and, because $S$ is one-dimensional, you may easily plot $f(x)$ on the given interval.  From any plot you can get close to the solution just by looking.


\medskip
\item (\texttt{fit})  \quad Consider the following 11 data points which are plotted below:

\bigskip
\begin{tabular}{c|ccccccccccc}
x & 0.000 & 0.100 & 0.200 & 0.300 & 0.400 & 0.500 & 0.600 & 0.700 &  0.800 &  0.900 &  1.000 \\
\hline
y & 4.914 & 3.666 & 2.289 & 1.655 & 1.029 & 0.739 & 0.393 & 0.090 & -0.197 & -0.721 & -0.971
\end{tabular}

\bigskip

\includegraphics[width=0.6\textwidth]{fitdata}
\end{center}

\medskip
Suppose we believe that this data can be fit by a function of the form
    $$g(x) = c_1 + c_2 x + c_3 e^{-5 x}.$$
If the sense of ``fit'' is that the sum of the squares of the misfits should be as small as possible then we would solve
	$$\min_{c \in \RR^3} f(c)$$
where we define this objective function as\footnote{The overall factor of $1/2$ is a convenience for differentiating.  Which is a hint about the standard algorithms for finding the minimum \dots} 
	$$f(c) = \frac{1}{2} \sum_{j=1}^{11} \left(g(x_j) - y_j\right)^2 = \frac{1}{2} \sum_{j=1}^{11} \left(c_1 + c_2 x_j + c_3 e^{-5 x_j} - y_j\right)^2.$$
Note $S=\RR^3$ because there are no constraints on the coefficients $c_i$.

We are \emph{not} finding $x_j$ or $y_j$ values in the minimization process!  We are finding $c_1,c_2,c_3$.  The data values $(x_j,y_j)$ merely determine the objective function.

\medskip
\item (\texttt{salmon})  \quad Ed and Thomas caught 21 salmon.  Of these, $x_1$ will be eaten fresh, which requires 2 time units per fish.  Then $x_2$ will be vacuum-packed and frozen (3 time units per fish) and another $x_3$ will be smoked and vacuum-packed (4 time units per fish).  Thus the total amount of processing time is $2 x_1 + 3 x_2 + 4 x_3$.  However, at most 2 fish can be eaten fresh before they go bad, and at most 10 fish can be smoked in the time allowed.  Find $x_1,x_2,x_3$ to minimize the total processing time.

This is a constrained minimization problem wherein $x_i$ are numbers of fish, \emph{which must be positive numbers}, and the objective function is the total processing time $f(x) = 2 x_1 + 3 x_2 + 4 x_3$:
	$$\min f(x) \qquad \text{subject to }\quad \begin{matrix} x_1 + x_2 + x_3 = 21 \\ 0 \le x_1 \le 2 \\ 0 \le x_2 \\ 0 \le x_3 \le 10 \end{matrix}$$
Note that the objective function and the constraint functions (e.g.~$g_1(x)=x_1+x_2+x_3$,$g_2=x_1$,\dots) are linear functions.  This is an \emph{linear programming} problem.

The feasible set $S\subset \RR^3$ includes all the constraints:
    $$S = \left\{x \in \RR^3\,\big|\,x_1 + x_2 + x_3 = 21, 0 \le x_1 \le 2, 0 \le x_2, \text{ and } 0 \le x_3 \le 10\right\}.$$
Defining $S$ allows us to put the problem in standard form $\min_S f(x)$.

\medskip
\item (\texttt{tsp})  \quad Jill sells amazing widgets that help you learn math.  To sell these devices she plans to visit cities A, F, J, N, W by starting and ending at city S.  Some cities have connecting flights and some do not; the one-way costs of the various flights are shown below in a \emph{graph} with costs (weights) on each connection (edge).  It is clear that she should visit each city exactly once, except for S.

This is an example of the famous \emph{traveling salesperson problem}.  Each possible itinerary is expressible as a seven-letter string like ``SANFWJS.''  If $x$ denotes such a feasible string then we may define the objective function $f(x)$ to be the cost of that itinerary; thus $f(x)$ is defined using the edge weights.  Finding a feasible itinerary for a big enough graph is generally nontrivial; it corresponds to finding a \emph{Hamiltonian cycle}.  One may, however, add in all remaining edges with large weights so that any itinerary $x$ is feasible and has a well-defined cost $f(x)$.

The problem \emph{could} be written in standard form
	$$\min_S f(x).$$
where $S = \{x\,|\,x \text{ is a feasible itinerary}\}$.  However, there is no easy way to describe $S$ by inequalities and equalities as as subset of some Euclidean space $\RR^n$ as above.

In any case, this is a \emph{discrete optimization} problem, not a continuous problem as expected in form (1.1) and the textbook generally.  That is, the set $S$ consists of discrete feasible itineraries.

\medskip
\item (\texttt{glacier})  \quad  The shape of a glacier on flat bedrock is approximately given by the solution to a constrained optimization problem.  In one spatial dimension the unknown solution $u(x)$ is a function, and the objective function $f[u]$ takes the function $u(x)$ as input and produces a single real number (as usual).  That is, in contrast to all the above examples, the input to the objective function is not a finite list (vector) of numbers.  Thus this problem is infinite-dimensional, a \emph{calculus of variations} example.

The feasible set in this specific problem is a set of functions defined on an interval $I$:
    $$S = \left\{u \,\big|\, u(x) \ge 0 \text{ is a differentiable function of } x\in I = [-100,100]\right\}.$$
The nontrivial constraint is that $u(x)$ is nonnegative, because it is a form of the ice thickness (below).  Note $x$ is in kilometers.

In this specific problem we have a rather artifical function which defines the rate of total snowfall or melt in a year:
    $$m(x) = \begin{cases} -3 + \frac{6}{90} (x+70), & -70 \le x \le 20, \\
                            3 - \frac{6}{50} (x-20), & 20 \le x \le 70.
             \end{cases}$$
The units of $m(x)$ are meters per year.  This function is graphed below.  Note that it is only snowing where $m(x)$ is positive; everywhere else it is melting.

\bigskip
\begin{center}
\includegraphics[width=0.5\textwidth]{massbalance}
\end{center}

The objective function is an integral:
    $$f[u] = \int_I \frac{\mu}{4} \left(u'(x)\right)^4 - m(x) u(x)\,dx$$

FIXME give value for $\mu$

FIXME $h=u^{n/(2n+2)} = u^{3/8}$ is actual thickness

FIXME acknowledge that discretization in $x$ is needed to make this finite-dimensional

\end{enumerate}
