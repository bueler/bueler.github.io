\subsection*{Goal}  The goal of the Math 661 project is for you to become familiar with either a modest class of optimization problems or a modest class of optimization algorithms.

\subsection*{Expectations}  Your project may be application-driven (\emph{choose the problem(s) first}) or algorithm-driven (\emph{choose the algorithm(s) first})---see page 3---but all projects must include a specific optimization problem and a specific optimization algorithm.  That is, you will implement at least one algorithm, i.e.~in \Matlab/\Python/ \Julia/etc., and apply your code to at least one example problem.

Both numerical computation and mathematical analysis are required.  For the latter you will analyze the problem(s) and algorithm(s) using theory from the textbook\footnote{Griva, Nash, and Sofer, \emph{Linear and Nonlinear Optimization}, 2nd ed., SIAM Press 2009.} and/or from other references.  Once your code is running you should provide some empirical (numerical experimentation) evidence regarding the error and/or performance of your algorithm(s).  Analysis is important, for reasons which include that it shows you have absorbed ideas from the course, and numerical evidence is important because it confirms that you understood the algorithm well enough to implement it correctly.

Your problem(s) must be in the following form:
\begin{equation}
\min_{x\in \RR^n} f(x) \quad \text{subject to} \quad \begin{matrix}
                                                      g_i(x) = 0, & i \in \mathcal{E}, \\
                                                      g_i(x) \ge 0, & i \in \mathcal{I},
                                                      \end{matrix}  \label{genform}
\end{equation}
though of course you may replace $\min$ with $\max$.  If your project is algorithm-driven then you will need to identify which such problems are solved by your algorithms(s).  Note your problems must be finite-dimensional ($\RR^n$), you must be able to identify the objective function $f(x)$ and a feasible set $S$ defined by finitely-many constraints $g_i(x)$.  There may be no constraints.  Note that form \eqref{genform} describes a very large class of problems.


\subsection*{Due dates}  FIXME There are two due dates for the project:

\medskip
\begin{itemize}
\item[\underline{I = Proposal:}]  Project part I is due Friday 9 November at the start of class.  (\emph{This is a change from the date on the syllabus.})  There are no format requirements for Project part I other than that it cannot be longer than two pages.

The content of the proposal should be to say precisely what problem(s) or algorithm(s) you want to look at.  Several quality references are \emph{expected}; online references are o.k.~but I find that many of informal online documents are of low quality.  Thus you should prioritize 

You spend less than (say) 6 hours on this.  But spending more time at this stage can be very effective, because you can talk about and play with ideas to get a clearer idea of what to write on your proposal.

This would be a good time to use a version control system, if you know how, so that your efforts grow in an organized manner and you don't lose stuff.

\medskip
\item[\underline{II = Complete project:}]  On Monday 12 December at 5pm you will submit the complete project as version II.  It will have the form suggested below, already drafted as version I, but all parts will be completed.

The total length must be 20 pages or less; I will not accept it if it is more than 20 pages.  The total time spent on version II of the project should be at most 20 hours.
\end{itemize}


\subsection*{Choosing a topic}  One of my jobs will be to help you choose problem(s) and algorithm(s) so that your project has reasonable difficulty.  I will likely advise you not to bite off too much!  It is very easy to get lost in the application, the algorithmic details, or in difficulties with codes or analysis.

You may not choose a topic which has been, or will be, adequately covered in the course.  For example, though the basic simplex method is not a good topic, implementations of the simplex method which respect sparsity are (Chapter 7).  Similarly, the classical Newton method is not a good subject but investigating quasi-Newton methods, line search methods, or trust region methods may be quite good choices (Chapters 11,12).  Your proposal allows me to give good feedback on this, perhaps a gentle nudge in the direction of a nice variation to study.

Here are three approaches to choosing a topic if you don't already have one:

\subsubsection*{Approach 1: Inspiration from Wikipedia page on mathematical optimization}  See the ``Applications,'' ``Major subfields,'' and ``Computational \dots techniques'' sections of

   \centerline{\href{https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mathematical_optimization}{\texttt{en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mathematical\_optimization}}}

\subsubsection*{Approach 2: Investigate skipped material from the textbook}  Consider choosing a section(s) that you find interesting and which we did not cover.  I am not really recommending just choosing a section at random; the Wikipedia page above is a better if you are starting from scratch.

\subsubsection*{Approach 3: Talk to your advisor and/or do something related to your thesis}  You can talk to me, but it will take a while for me to know what you are interested in.  It would be better to talk to your thesis advisor (if you have one).  It is reasonable to ask ``are there optimization problems related to my expected thesis''?  Broadly-speaking these might relate to optimal design or parameter fitting, or to algorithms which arise in your field of interest.  There may be a paper to read about optimization in your field.
