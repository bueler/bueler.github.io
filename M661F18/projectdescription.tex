\subsection*{Goals and expectations} The goal of this project is for you to become familiar either with a kind of optimization problems or of optimization algorithms.  Both some numerical computation and some mathematical analysis are \emph{required} on your project.

Your project may be application-driven (\emph{choose the problems first}) or algorithm-driven (\emph{choose the algorithm first}).  In either case you will implement at least one algorithm in \Matlab, or other language, and apply your code to at least one example problem.  Then you will analyze the algorithms and results using theory from the textbook or other references.  Part of this is to provide some empirical evidence regarding the error and/or performance of your algorithm.  Such analysis is important; you can show that you have absorbed ideas from the course.

Both the problem(s) and the algorithm(s) are important, and one of my jobs will be to help you choose them.  A significant way I can help is to advise you \emph{not} to bite off too much!  It is very easy to get lost in the application itself, the algorithmic details, or in difficulties with codes or analysis.

In any case your problem(s) must be in the following form, or your algorithm must work on problems in the following form:
    $$\min_{x\in \RR^n} f(x) \quad \text{subject to} \quad \begin{matrix}
                                                      g_i(x) = 0, & i \in \mathcal{E}, \\
                                                      g_i(x) \ge 0, & i \in \mathcal{I}
                                                      \end{matrix}$$
(Of course you may replace ``$\min$'' with ``$\max$''.)  That is, your problem must be finite-dimensional ($\RR^n$), you must be able to identify the objective function $f(x)$ and the feasible set $S$, with the latter defined by finitely-many constraints $g_i(x)$ of identified type.  There may be no constraints.  Then you will find an algorithm (or algorithms) to solve the problems numerically, and then demonstrate and analyze the results.


\subsection*{Due dates} There are two due dates for the project:

\medskip
\begin{itemize}
\item[\underline{I = Proposal:}]  Project part I is due Friday 9 November at the start of class.  (\emph{This is a change from the date on the syllabus.})  There are no format requirements for Project part I other than that it cannot be longer than two pages.

The content of the proposal should be to say precisely what problem(s) or algorithm(s) you want to look at.  Several quality references are \emph{expected}; online references are o.k.~but I find that many of informal online documents are of low quality.  Thus you should prioritize 

You spend less than (say) 6 hours on this.  But spending more time at this stage can be very effective, because you can talk about and play with ideas to get a clearer idea of what to write on your proposal.

This would be a good time to use a version control system, if you know how, so that your efforts grow in an organized manner and you don't lose stuff.

\medskip
\item[\underline{II = Complete project:}]  On Monday 12 December at 5pm you will submit the complete project as version II.  It will have the form suggested below, already drafted as version I, but all parts will be completed.

The total length must be 20 pages or less; I will not accept it if it is more than 20 pages.  The total time spent on version II of the project should be at most 20 hours.
\end{itemize}


\newpage
\subsection*{Choosing a topic}  Here are three approaches:

\subsubsection*{Approach 1: Talk to an advisor and/or do something related to your thesis}  You can talk to me, but it will take a while for me to know what you are interested in.  It would be better for you to talk to your thesis advisor if you already have one.  It is reasonable to ask ``are there optimization problems related to my expected thesis''?  Broadly-speaking these might relate to optimal design or parameter fitting, or to algorithms which already arise in your field of interest.  There may be a paper to read about optimization in your fieldt.

\subsubsection*{Approach 2: Inspiration from Wikipedia page on mathematical optimization}  If the above does not apply to you, I stongly-suggest you start with this next approach, unless you have a clear desire and plan already.  Namely, see the ``Applications'' section of

   \centerline{\href{https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mathematical_optimization}{\texttt{en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mathematical\_optimization}}}

\noindent This page is that it has good links to both example applications and to sub-fields of the rather broad and diffuse area called ``optimization.''

\subsubsection*{Approach 3: Investigate skipped material from Nocedal \& Wright}  It is practically true that there are an infinite number of topics you could choose from the textbook.  (It is more of an encyclopedia, not really a textbook that fits in a semester.)  Please \emph{do} choose a section if you roughly understand the basic idea \emph{and} you find it interesting.  Otherwise, however, please \emph{do not} just choose a section at random as a starting point for a project.  The Wikipedia page on \emph{mathematical optimization} is a much better starting point if you do not already have an idea.

The following bulleted list gives sections of Nocedal \& Wright that:
\renewcommand{\labelenumi}{\roman{enumi})}
\begin{enumerate}
\item I plan to either skip entirely in lecture and homework, or address partially/lightly,
\item \emph{and} which contain algorithmic ideas that might make good starting points.
\end{enumerate}
Here's the bulleted list:
\begin{itemize}
\item 3.4, 3.5
\item 4.1, 4.2, 4.3, 4.4, 4.5
\item 6.2, 6.3, 6.4
\item 7.1, 7.2, 7.3, 7.4
\item 8.2
\item 9.2, 9.3, 9.4, 9.6
\item 10.3, 10.4
\item 11.2, 11.3
\item 12.5, 12.6, 12.9
\item 13.3, 13.4, 13.5, 13.6, 13.7
\item 14.1, 14.2, 14.3
\item 15.4, 15.5
\item 16.1, 16.2, 16.3, 16.5, 16.6, 16.7
\item 17.1, 17.2, 17.3, 17.4
\item 18.1, 18.2, 18.3, 18.4, 18.5, 18.6
\item 19.2, 19.3, 19.4, 19.5, 19.6
\end{itemize}
