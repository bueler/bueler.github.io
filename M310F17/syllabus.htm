<h2 style="text-align:left;"> Course Content and Topics: </h2>

This course will introduce you to numerical analysis.  You'll learn methods for solving certain problems of applied mathematics on computers, and why those methods work.  We will solve problems in calculus, linear algebra, and differential equations, and in areas that are new to you.  You will be expected to understand both the theory and practice of numerical methods.  Both theory and practice will be covered in lecture, and every homework assignment will have both kinds of questions.  Some exercises will ask you to explain a concept, some to demonstrate an idea by a short hand calculation, and others will require you to write running programs.  We will use the mathematical programming language <i>Matlab</i> (or the free equivalent <i>Octave</i> or the free alternative <i>Python</i>) from the beginning, and then over the semester on every assignment.  On the homework you will be expected to turn numerical algorithms into functioning programs.  A combination of lectures and homework together make up the core of the class.  Getting the most out of both of these is your responsibility, though I have a responsibility to make them worth your time.  You should ask questions in class, both about the lecture content and about homework assignments.

FIXME Homework assignments and a student-chosen project, tentatively in the form of a short slide-show, will include actual implementations in <em>Matlab/Octave</em> or another suitable language of your choice.  (I will support <em>Matlab/Octave</em> but you may use other languages for assignments and the project.)  Lectures will include <em>Matlab/Octave</em> demonstrations, plus help getting started with it, whenever I can fit it in.  However, <em>you</em> must show initiative in learning actual numerical computation, especially if you have not done it before.<br><br>

FIXME We will not be satisfied with seeing pretty pictures coming from the computer.  Instead we will be concerned with the degree to which our numbers correctly approximate the PDE problem.  We will seek the underlying linear algebra structure of these problems, in terms of vectors and matrices.  Abstract and precise thought, that is, actual mathematics, is essential when making choices among numerical methods, and all homework assignments will have mathematical exercises.  In these you will be asked to "show" and "prove", and, while formal proof style is not important, you will need to give clear and sufficiently-general logical arguments.<br>

<h2 style="text-align:left;">Goals and Outcomes:</h2>

FIXME At the end of the course you will be able to evaluate and use numerical tools for solving many scientific and engineering problems.  You will be able to code some of the basic methods (i.e. for prototyping more serious solutions), and you will have the mathematical start needed for learning other approaches like the finite element method and spectral methods.  Also, student competence with actual scientific computing is a goal of the course: You will be comfortable using <em>Matlab/Octave</em> both as a "supercalculator" and as a programming language.<br>

<h2 style="text-align:left;">Assigned Work:</h2>

FIXME Weekly homework forms 50% of your score for the class.  The homework consists of by-hand computations, construction/comprehension of numerical algorithms, implementation of numerical algorithms in <em>Matlab/Octave</em>, including basic visualizations, rigorously-justified examples and counter-examples, and some proofs.<br><br>

FIXME Homework assignments, and their due dates, will be regularly posted at the Course Website <a href="index.html">bueler.github.io/M301F17/</a>.  The site also has a daily schedule of topics which will be updated on an ongoing basis to reflect what topics were actually covered each day.

<h2 style="text-align:left;">How Your Grade is Determined:</h2>

FIXME There will be <span style="font-weight: bold;">one in-class Midterm Exam</span>, covering basic concepts and definitions, and a <span style="font-weight: bold;">take-home Final Exam</span>.  There will be a <span style="font-weight: bold;">project in two parts</span>, with the first part due midsemester and the second due before final exams:<br><br>

FIXME Based on your raw (homework, project, and exams) total, I guarantee grades according to the following schedule:<br><br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;  90 - 100 % = <b>A</b>, &nbsp;79 - 89 % = <b>B</b>, &nbsp;68 - 78 % = <b>C</b>, &nbsp;57 - 67 % = <b>D</b>, &nbsp;0 - 56 % = <b>F</b>.<br><br>

This schedule is a guarantee.  I reserve the right to increase your grade <i>above</i> this schedule based on the actual difficulty of the work and/or upon average class performance.<br>


<h2 style="text-align:left;">Policies:</h2>

The Dept of Mathematics and Statistics has reasonable policies on incompletes, late withdrawals, early final examinations, etc.; see <a href="http://www.uaf.edu/dms/policies/">www.uaf.edu/dms/policies</a>. &nbsp;  You are covered by the UAF Student Code of Conduct. &nbsp;  I will work with the Office of Disabilities Services (208 WHIT, 474-5655) to provide reasonable accommodation to student with disabilities.<br>


<h2 style="text-align:left;"> Prerequisites:</h2>

Officially, these are the <em>Prerequisites: MATH F302 Differential Equations or MATH F314 Linear Algebra or permission of instructor.</em>  The idea is that you will have completed the calculus sequence and done a bit more.  Both differential equations and linear algebra topics occur in the class, but they depend very little on previous course exposure; the ideas are introduced as needed.  Also, prior exposure to <em>some</em> kind of programming is useful, but Matlab is introduced from the beginning.<br><br>

FIXME In other words, this is an applied and computational mathematics course at the introductory graduate level.  Students come from math, computer science, physics, geophysics, engineering, and indeed all over the technical subjects at UAF, and I am aware of this fact!  I will devote substantial class time, especially at the beginning of the semester, to collecting together the many bits of needed prequisite knowledge.  However, <em>you</em> must show initiative in recalling prerequiste knowledge in a meaningful and timely way, especially when I point out directly that certain prerequisite knowledge is needed.  In all these aspects, this course is similar to MATH 614 Numerical Linear Algebra and MATH 661 Optimization.<br><br>
