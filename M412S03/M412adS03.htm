<big>Geometry is most interesting when it varies from place to place. &nbsp;Gauss
discovered, as a surveyor, the connection between the angles in a triangulation
of the surface of the earth and the amount by which maps of the earth cannot
be flattened without deforming or tearing. &nbsp;Riemann took this understanding
and extracted the fundamental definitions. &nbsp;Then he generalized to any
dimension. &nbsp;After discovering special relativity, which is a <i>new</i>
but <i>flat </i>geometry, Einstein realized how to slightly change the Riemannian
tools to apply to gravity--he discovered that gravity <i>is </i>the amount
by which the geometry of our space varies from place to place. &nbsp;For
the last century, mathematicians and physicists have been trying to understand
how quantum mechanics works when the laboratory is curved, which we know
it is!<br>
<br>
This course will introduce the mathematics for the story. &nbsp;You need
to know multivariable calculus and how do both calculations and proofs. &nbsp;With
those tools you will get a quite complete understanding of the geometry of
curves and surfaces, and an introduction to the general theory of Riemannian
geometry.<br>

Differential geometry is basic to the <i>fundamental</i> understanding of:<br>

  <li><big>mechanics and optics</big></li>
  <li><big>topology of manifolds</big></li>
  <li><big>electricity and magnetism&nbsp;</big></li>
  <li><big>general relativity</big></li>
  <li><big>symmetry groups</big></li>
  <li><big>unified field theories</big></li>

<p><b>Course Description:&nbsp;&nbsp; </b>Differential geometry of curves 
and surfaces leading toward an abstract view of spaces. &nbsp;The first fourth
of the course will be the geometry of curves, which was introduced in calculus
III--we will do a more complete job. &nbsp;The next half of the course will
be the geometry of surfaces. &nbsp;We will see the contributions of Gauss
and Riemann and lay the foundations for the geometry of curved manifolds
of any dimension. &nbsp;The last fourth of the course will be a survey of,
and introduction to, manifolds, Riemannian geometry, Maxwell's equations
and gravitation.<br>
<b>Course Grading:&nbsp;&nbsp; </b>Letter grade based on 40% homework and
60% exams.<br>
