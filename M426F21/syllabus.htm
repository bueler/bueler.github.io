<h3 style="text-align:left;"> Course Websites: </h3>

There are <em>two</em> websites:

  <ul>
    <li> <em>public</em> materials and schedule: <a href="index.html">bueler.github.io/M426F21/</a></li>
    <li> enrolled students: <a href="https://alaska.instructure.com/courses/2350">Canvas course website at https://alaska.instructure.com/courses/2350</a><br></li>
  </ul>

The public site has a daily schedule of topics, due dates, links to assignments, links to Matlab examples and solutions, and other helpful content.  It will be updated on an ongoing basis to reflect what topics were actually covered.<br><br>

The Canvas site has password-protected stuff like your grades and exam/homework solutions.  It also has the links for the Zoom lecture and recorded Zoom sessions for each day.  However, <em>most information is at the public site</em>.

<h3 style="text-align:left;"> Description </h3>

This course introduces numerical analysis using lecture, small group work in class, homework, and exams.  We will learn methods for solving certain problems of applied mathematics on computers, and why those methods work.  We will solve (and reconsider) problems in calculus, linear algebra, and differential equations, and in some areas that are new to you.<br><br>

<em>Direct and iterative solutions of systems of equations, interpolation, numerical differentiation and integration, numerical solutions of ordinary differential equations, and error analysis.</em>

<h3 style="text-align:left;"> Goals and Outcomes </h3>

By the end of the course you will be able to evaluate and use numerical tools for solving a variety of mathematical, scientific, and engineering problems.  You will be able to code basic methods, for example for prototyping more substantial solutions.  You will have the mathematical start needed for learning numerical approaches to new problems like optimization and partial differential equations.  Student competence with actual scientific computing, not just theory, is a goal of the course.  At completion you will be comfortable using Matlab (or equivalent) both as a "supercalculator" and as a programming language.

<h3 style="text-align:left;"> Prerequisites </h3>

Official prerequisites: <em>MATH F302 Differential Equations <em>OR</em> MATH F314 Linear Algebra.  Recommended: Knowledge of programming.</em><br><br>

Regarding the two MATH courses here, some mathematical maturity beyond calculus is more important than the specific content of either course.  However, solving basic differential equations and linear systems by numerical means will be two of the topics covered in MATH 426.<br><br>

In terms of UAF courses "knowledge of programming" might translate to "some Computer Science course or ES 201".  However, what is actually needed is willingness to learn how to write simple codes in the (easy and protected) programming environment of Matlab.  Many students have succeeded with this as their first class with required programming.<br><br>

Generally speaking, students come to this class from math, statistics, computer science, physics, geophysics, engineering, and indeed from any of the technical subjects at UAF.  Thus I will devote substantial class time, especially at the beginning of the semester, to collecting the bits of needed prequisite knowledge.  However, you must show initiative in a meaningful and timely way, especially when I make it clear that review is needed.<br><br>

<h3 style="text-align:left;"> Student Obligations </h3>

You will be expected to understand both the theory and practice of numerical analysis as presented in the lecture and the textbook.  Both theory and practice will be emphasized on homework and exams.<br><br>

You will use the mathematical programming language <a href="https://www.mathworks.com/academia/student_version.html"><em>Matlab</em></a>, or the free equivalent <a href="https://www.gnu.org/software/octave/"><em>Octave</em></a>, or another equivalent language, on every homework assignment.  (Even the first assignment!  I will help with getting started, especially in the first week.)  On many homework problems you will be expected to turn numerical algorithms into functioning programs.  Other problems will ask you to explain a concept and/or to demonstrate an idea by a hand calculation.<br><br>

The combination of lectures and homework together make up the core of the class.  Getting the most out of both of these is <em>your</em> responsibility.  You should ask questions in class, both about the lecture content and about the homework assignments.

<h3 style="text-align:left;">The Hybrid Classroom:</h3>

There are two sections of the class, in-person (F01) and online (FXA), but they are treated as one course and they occur simultaneously.<br><br>

In this "hybrid" set-up, each lecture will be a recorded (and recurring) Zoom session generated from Duckering 352.  The link for the Zoom session is inside Canvas; go to <a href="https://alaska.instructure.com/courses/2350">https://alaska.instructure.com/courses/2350</a>.  The Zoom recordings will be linked from inside Canvas, and thus not be public.<br><br>

My intention is to treat all students the same, regarding proctored assessments (see below) and participation during class time.  Students in each sections have some obligations to help make the hybrid mode work:
  <ul>
    <li><em>F01 in-person students:</em> To allow in-class play with Matlab, and to help classroom communication for e.g. group work, please bring a laptop if you can, and join the Zoom session so you see the online students.</li>
    <li><em>FXA online students:</em> Please sign into the Zoom session (link at <a href="https://alaska.instructure.com/courses/2350">https://alaska.instructure.com/courses/2350</a>) before class and participate as energetically as you can.  Keep your camera on if possible.  For in-class group work you will want to get the PDF of worksheets etc. from <a href="index.html">bueler.github.io/M426F21/</a> <em>before class starts</em> if possible.  Note that you must turn in homework and take-home assessments electronically, namely as clear and combined PDFs, which may require scanning documents.  You will need to schedule proctoring for the in-class assessments (see below).</li>
  </ul>

<h3 style="text-align:left;"> Assigned Work and Exams </h3>

FIXME FROM HERE

Weekly homework forms 45% of your score for the course.  Homework assignments, and their due dates, will be regularly posted at the Course Website <a href="index.html">bueler.github.io/M426F21/</a>.<br><br>

There will be one in-class Midterm Exam and an in-class Final Exam.

<h3 style="text-align:left;"> Grade Determination </h3>

Based on your raw score total, I will assign grades according to the following schedule:<br><br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;  90 - 100 % = <b>A</b>, &nbsp;79 - 89 % = <b>B</b>, &nbsp;68 - 78 % = <b>C</b>, &nbsp;57 - 67 % = <b>D</b>, &nbsp;0 - 56 % = <b>F</b>.<br><br>

This schedule is a guarantee.  I reserve the right to increase your grade <i>above</i> these ranges based on the actual difficulty of the work and/or upon average class performance.<br>

<h3 style="text-align:left;"> Policies </h3>

The Dept of Mathematics and Statistics has reasonable policies on incompletes, late withdrawals, early final examinations, etc.; see <a href="http://www.uaf.edu/dms/policies/">www.uaf.edu/dms/policies</a>.  You are covered by the UAF Student Code of Conduct.   UA is an AA/EO employer and educational institution and prohibits illegal discrimination against any individual: <a href="https://alaska.edu/nondiscrimination">alaska.edu/nondiscrimination</a>.   I will work with the Office of Disabilities Services (208 WHIT, 474-5655) to provide reasonable accommodation to students with disabilities.<br>

<h3 style="text-align:left;"> Student Protections Statement </h3>

UAF embraces and grows a culture of respect, diversity, inclusion, and caring. Students at this university are protected against sexual harassment and discrimination (Title IX).
