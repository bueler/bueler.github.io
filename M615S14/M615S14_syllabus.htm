    <b><font size="+1">Course Description:</font></b>&nbsp; 3.0 credits.&nbsp;
    We cover methods for numerical approximations to partial differential
    equations (PDEs) and related problems on computers.&nbsp; There will be some coverage of
    numerical methods for ordinary differential equations (ODEs).&nbsp; PDEs are
    the underlying structure for most problems of flow, fields, thermodynamics,
    deformation, quantum mechanics, chemistry, and so on, but also finance and population dynamics.
    &nbsp; We do mathematical analysis of these numerical methods, with both
    practical and abstract approaches to this numerical analysis:&nbsp; (i) how
    are these methods implemented, verified, and used?&nbsp; (ii) when are they
    stable? and&nbsp; (iii) do we know in advance that they converge?&nbsp; 
    The emphasis will be on finite difference methods for PDEs.&nbsp; I will only
    gloss other methods (e.g. finite volume and element) for PDEs.<br>
    <br>Lectures will include <span style="font-style: italic;">Matlab</span>
    demonstrations whenever I can fit them in.&nbsp; I will help you get started
    with <span style="font-style: italic;">Matlab</span>, but you must show
    initiative in learning actual numerical computation.&nbsp;
    Homework assignments and a student-chosen project will include actual
    implementations in <span style="font-style: italic;">Matlab</span>.&nbsp;
    Abstract and precise thought is, however, essential to make choices
    among numerical methods for solving major problems.&nbsp; Thus all homework
    assignments will have mathematical exercises, and in these you will be asked
    to "show" and "prove".&nbsp; Formal proof style is not important, but you'll
    need to give clear presentations of sufficiently-general logical arguments.<br>
    <br>We will think in terms of vectors and
    matrices.&nbsp; We will not be satisfied with seeing lots of numbers or pretty
    pictures from our computer programs.&nbsp; Instead we will be concerned with
    the degree to which our numbers represent what we claim they approximate.&nbsp; We
    will seek the underlying linear algebra structure of PDE problems.&nbsp; The
    course will include some nonlinear examples, for which one uses a
    sequence of approximating linear problems.<br>
    <br>
    <b><font size="+1">Goals:&nbsp;</font></b> At the end this course you will
    not be a professional numerical analyst.&nbsp; But you will be able to
    evaluate and use many numerical tools for solving scientific and engineering
    problems, and you will be able to code some of the basic methods (i.e. for
    the purpose of prototyping more serious solutions).&nbsp; Furthermore you
    will have the mathematical start needed to take the next steps to learn the
    finite element method, spectral methods, matrix methods, and broader
    scientific computing.<br>

    <big><span style="font-weight: bold;">Calendar and Course Webpage:</span></big>&nbsp;
    A day-to-day (tentative) schedule for the semester is at the course webpage <a href="http://bueler.github.io/M615S14/">bueler.github.io/M615S14/</a>.<br>
    <br>
    <b><big>Prerequisites:</big>&nbsp;</b> <span style="font-style: italic;">Informally:
      </span>undergraduate ordinary differential equations, undergraduate linear
    algebra, exposure to the basic ideas of numerical analysis, and exposure to
    Fourier series and separation of variables (for solving the classical linear
    PDE boundary value problems).&nbsp; Also some exposure to computer
    programming.<span style="font-style: italic;">&nbsp; Formally</span><meta http-equiv="content-type" content="text/html; charset=utf-8">: "Prerequisites: CS F201, MATH F310, MATH F314, MATH F421, MATH F422 or permission of instructor."<br>
    <br>
    <b><big>Textbook:</big>&nbsp;</b> The <span style="font-weight: bold;">required</span>
    text is K. Morton and D. Mayers, <span style="font-style: italic;">Numerical

Solution
of
      Partial Differential Equations</span>, 2nd ed. Cambridge Univ. Press 2005.
    We will cover
    chapters 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, and 6.<br>
    <br>
    <b><font size="+1">Your Grade = Homework + Project</font></b><b><font size="+1">
        + Midterm</font></b><b><font size="+1">:</font></b>&nbsp; <b>Sixty
      percent</b> of the course, and the grade, will be based on <b>weekly
      homework assignments</b>, including a final assignment which will be
    worth double an ordinary assignment.&nbsp; You will be asked to think abstractly on
    some problems and to use <i>Matlab</i> on others.&nbsp;&nbsp; (Expect to write programs
    about a half-page long.)<br>
    <br>
    It is assumed that students in this class have in mind,
    or can acquire, specific modelling problems in applied fields
    which can be used for a <span style="font-weight: bold;">project</span>.&nbsp;&nbsp;
    These will mostly, but not exclusively, be PDE problems.&nbsp; Students
    often use a simplification of a thesis/dissertation project, for
    instance.&nbsp; I am eager to help and advise on choosing and refining such
    problems.&nbsp; <span style="font-weight: bold;">Twenty-five</span><b>
      percent</b> of the grade in the course will be on the project.&nbsp; Two
    project assignments will be given, the first part a preparatory stage due
    midsemester, and the remainder due at finals time.&nbsp; Both mathematical
    analysis and actual numerical computation are required on your project.<br>
    <br>
    Finally, there will be a one-hour in-class <span style="font-weight: bold;">midterm
      exam</span> worth only <span style="font-weight: bold;">fifteen percent</span>
    of the course grade.&nbsp; The purpose is to give a midsemester opportunity
    to review basics before expanding our goals in the second half.<br>

      <span style="font-style: italic;">Matlab</span> so the same programs will

    <p>Copious online resources are available
      for learning <span style="font-style: italic;">Matlab/Octave/pylab</span>.&nbsp; They are all languages designed to do numerical analysis
      coursework.&nbsp; Mathematical and graphical inputs and outputs are easily
      manipulated.&nbsp; Matrices appearing in problems can be easily
      analyzed.&nbsp; Many of the operations appearing in numerical problems are
      natural and quick and require less work than in compiled
      languages like <i>C</i> or <i>FORTRAN</i>.</p></body></html>
