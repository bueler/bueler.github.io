    <b><font size="+1">Overview:</font></b>&nbsp; One of the goals in Math 615 is to give
    students practical experience in numerical analysis by working on a project
    on a topic chosen by the student<span style="font-style: italic;">.</span>&nbsp; Obvious advice for graduate students is to pick a project in
    consultation with your advisor, but of course that is not a requirement.<span style="font-style: italic;"></span>&nbsp; Both mathematical analysis and actual numerical computation are required
    on this project.&nbsp; See the subject suggestions and content requirements below.<br>
    <br>
    <b><font size="+1">Timing and Due Dates:</font></b><br>
    <ul>
      <li>You will submit a short <span style="font-weight: bold;">Version 1.0
          on Friday 4/11 at class time</span>.&nbsp; This part is worth 10% of the course grade.<span style="font-weight: bold;"><br>
    </span></li>
      <li><span style="font-weight: bold;"></span>You will submit a final <span style="font-weight: bold;">Version 2.0 on Thursday 5/8 at 5pm</span><span style="font-weight: bold;"></span>.&nbsp; This part is worth 15% of the course grade.</li>
    </ul>
    <big>
    </big>
    <p><big style="font-weight: bold;">Project categories:</big>&nbsp;
      You should pick a <span style="font-style: italic;">continuum
        mathematical model</span> like<br>
    </p>
    <ul>
    </ul>
    <ol>
      <li>a (single or small system of) partial differential equation(s), or </li>
      <li>a (single or small system of) delay differential equation(s), or </li>
      <li>a single stochastic differential equation.</li>
    </ol>
    <ul>
    </ul>
    <p><span style="font-style: italic;">These are the only allowed
        possibilities.&nbsp; </span>On the version 1.0 submission,<span style="font-style: italic;">
        identify which one of these </span>[1,2,3]<span style="font-style: italic;">
        it is!</span><br>
    </p>
    <p>Note that most ODE-only problems lead to numerical analysis
      rather unlike the content of the course, and thus are not allowed.&nbsp; <br>
    </p>
    <p>Your particular problem, namely the question you are trying
      to answer by numerical analysis, could be<br>
    </p>
    <ul>
    </ul>
    <ol style="list-style-type: lower-alpha;">
      <li>an initial and boundary value problem, or</li>
      <li>a (purely) boundary value problem, or</li>
      <li>an "eigen" analysis (i.e. finding the modes of a system),
        or<br>
      </li>
      <li>an inverse problem.<br>
      </li>
    </ol>
    <ol>
      <ol>
      </ol>
    </ol>
    <ol>
    </ol>
    <span style="font-style: italic;"></span>On the version 1.0
    submission, <span style="font-style: italic;">you must identify which one
      of these </span>[a,b,c,d]<span style="font-style: italic;"> you are
      doing!</span>&nbsp;
In rare cases your problem may be in a fifth category "e".&nbsp; You
will want to clearly identify that and talk to me in advance of
submitting version 1.0.<br>
<br>
In summary I want to see a clear statement of the type of the problem type, such as "... an initial/boundary
    problem for a nonlinear evolution equation of parabolic type..." or "... an
    inverse problem for a linear, elliptic boundary value problem..." or "... an
    initial value problem for a delay differential equation ...".<br>
<br>
For version 1.0 you must give several references, and these should
include enough about the problem to identify the category, among other
things.<br>
    <br>
    <big><span style="font-weight: bold;">Subject suggestions:</span></big>&nbsp;
These
<span style="font-style: italic;">suggestions</span>
    appear alphabetically, thus in no particular order.&nbsp; They are all
    basically in categories 1a, 1b, or 1c in the above taxonomy.&nbsp; There is varying intrinsic difficulty to
    the standard instances of these suggested problems, but I know enough
    about each of these to be able to advise on how much you should include, so
    as to avoid becoming bogged down, and I also know enough to be able to
    "weight for difficulty" at the time of grading.&nbsp; Please google the suggestion below if
    you find it interesting; look for a wikipedia page for sure.<br>

    <big><span style="font-weight: bold;">Content requirements:</span></big>&nbsp;
Once you choose a subject (i.e. the continuum problem) you will choose a numerical scheme or schemes.<br>
<br>
There should be some explanation of your numerical scheme choice.&nbsp;
"Ease of implementation" is a totally-valid reason to choose a
(consistent) scheme!&nbsp; Other reasons might be stability or order of
accuracy.&nbsp; It might also be the case that you are interested in
learning about that kind of scheme, so you might write "I want to learn
about implicit schemes for nonlinear equations" or "I want to learn
about high-quality transport schemes", for example.<br>
<br>
For
your
    chosen scheme or schemes applied to your chosen continuum mathematical
    model, you will do a numerical <span style="font-style: italic;">analysis</span>,
    in addition to a computed example. In particular, two actions are <span style="font-style: italic;">required</span>:<br>
    <ol style="list-style-type: upper-alpha;">
      <li>numerical <span style="font-style: italic;">analysis</span></li>
      <li>practical computation<br>
      </li>
      
    </ol>
    Note on requirement A: You must make some attempt to understand and explain
    the <span style="font-style: italic;">efficiency, stability,</span> <span style="font-style: italic;">convergence</span>, and<span style="font-style: italic;"> accuracy</span>
of your numerical scheme(s).&nbsp; In particular, for each of the
following actions you should ask whether it is possible and meaningful
to do so, and if so you should do it.&nbsp; Concretely, I expect you to
do at least two of these analyses:<br>
    <ol style="list-style-type: lower-roman;">
      <li>compute truncation error and show consistency<br>
</li>
      <li>do stability analysis<br>
      </li>
      <li>prove convergence [<span style="font-style: italic;">rarely possible</span>]<br>
      </li>
      <li>assess the computational cost of the algorithm</li>
      <li>manufacture (or otherwise find) an exact solution, and verify with it.<br>
      </li>
    </ol>If you are unable to accomplish at least two of the above actions, talk to me.&nbsp; It may be that your problem is too hard.<br>
<br>
I do not expect you to <em>derive</em> the equations of
    the continuum model, though you may do so (e.g. briefly in an appendix).&nbsp; That is a subject for other courses.&nbsp;
    However, <span style="font-style: italic;">do</span> briefly explain the physical/engineering/mathematical context as a way of
    introducing the problem.&nbsp; Carefully state the equations of the model,
    giving precise references including a source of the derivation.&nbsp; Explain
    the symbols you use; you <span style="font-style: italic;">must</span>
define new symbols that are not already used in Morton &amp;
Mayers.&nbsp; Explain the role/meaning of your particular computation.<br><br>
    As stated above, you are required to do some practical computation in <span style="font-style: italic;">Matlab</span>, though I do not expect you to produce a production-quality code.&nbsp; Rather, your
    goal should be a functional and readable prototype.&nbsp; (Build something
    you can build upon!)&nbsp; Please use <span style="font-style: italic;">Matlab</span>'s
    built-in numerical linear algebra, and don't write your own.&nbsp; In some
    cases it will be appropriate to use <em>Matlab's</em> built-in ODE or root
    solvers.&nbsp; You don't need to use <span style="font-style: italic;">Matlab</span>
    tricks, but generally learning to vectorize and avoid loops will help you
    understand.<br>
    <br>
    You may try methods other than finite differences for your practical
    computation, for instance finite volume, finite element, or spectral
    methods.&nbsp; But, because these methods differ both in implementation and
    analysis from what is addressed in class, working with them will be
    intrinsically harder because the required numerical analysis will be
    harder.&nbsp; See me if you want your project to go in this direction.<br>
    <br>
    In what follows I state what <span style="font-style: italic;">you</span>
will turn in at various stages.&nbsp; Some of the work is mine,
however.&nbsp; I will be giving you feedback on version 1.0 which will
be intended to improve your grade on v2.0.&nbsp; And I will be happy to
talk to you about your project at any stage.<br>
    <br>
    <p><big style="font-weight: bold;">Length and format of project Version 1.0
        (due Friday 4/11 at class time):&nbsp; </big><big><small>The point here is to <big style="font-style: italic;">do
            a little bit of everything that will go into the final product.</big><big><small>&nbsp;
Version 1.0 should be a useful skeleton on which to build v2.0.&nbsp;
It needs to be readable but it need not be polished.</small></big><br>
        </small></big></p>
    <p><big><small>The length should be between 5 and 10 pages total.&nbsp;
          Please include the following 7 section headings, with this content:<br>
        </small></big></p>
    <ol>
      <li><span style="font-weight: bold;">Introduction</span>&nbsp; (including
        scientific/engineering context and sketch/gloss of the numerical
        analysis you do)<br>
      </li>
      <li><span style="font-weight: bold;">Continuum Model and Problem</span>&nbsp;
        (here should go the PDE itself, etc, and clear specification of the
        particular problem including boundary conditions and parameters; give
        meaning of symbols; include a not-completely-trivial exact solution, if
        you can, here or in an appendix)</li>
      <li><span style="font-weight: bold;">Numerical Scheme</span>&nbsp; (state the
        method, discuss the reasons for this choice, discuss implementability
        and efficiency; small excerpts of the code may go here)<br>
      </li>
      <li><span style="font-weight: bold;">Analysis</span>&nbsp; (truncation error,
        stability, convergence, cost of algorithm, verification results)<br>
      </li>
      <li><span style="font-weight: bold;">Results&nbsp;</span> (show pictures and a few key numbers; note that a section called "Conclusion" is not necessary)<span style="font-weight: bold;"></span><br>
      </li>
      <li style="font-weight: bold;">References<span style="font-weight: normal;">&nbsp;
          (at least three; quality matters)</span><br>
      </li>
      <li><span style="font-weight: bold;">Appendix(s)&nbsp;</span> (put the
        actual codes here, tangential analysis or computation, failed attempts
        if significant)</li>
    </ol>
    The Results/ part should be quite short, and may be empty, in
    v1.0.&nbsp; That is, do not draw definitive conclusions
    yet.<br>
<br>
<big><small>I recommend having an an electronic form of v1.0
       , so that it can be modified into v2.0 most easily, but when you turn in v1.0 and v2.0 they should be on paper.&nbsp; </small></big><big><small>Please use
        ordinary 8.5x11 letter paper and staple it in the upper left corner.&nbsp;
        Please do not put it in a folder, etc.; I will have a stack of these
        things to grade and I don't need yours to take up extra space.</small></big><big><small>&nbsp;
Please make it double-sided if
        possible.</small></big><br>
    <br>
    <big style="font-weight: bold;">Length and format of project Version 2.0
      (due Thursday 5/8 at 5pm):&nbsp;</big><big><small>
Now fill out the version 1.0 skeleton, of course, and think through
your approach given the feedback you get on v1.0.&nbsp; You will
undoubtedly need to alter your earlier plans, so don't worry if v2.0
has different computational or analytical details than v1.0.&nbsp;
Version 2.0 is final, so I encourage you to make it reasonably clean
and neat.&nbsp; </small></big><big><small>The
length
        should be between <big><span style="font-style: italic;">15 and 25
            pages total (with 25 a firm maximum)</span></big> and should include the same section headings and other format requirements as for v1.0 (see above).</small></big><br>
