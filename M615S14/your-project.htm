    <b><font size="+1">Overview:</font></b>&nbsp; One of my goals is to give
    students practical experience in numerical analysis by working on a project
    of direct interest <span style="font-style: italic;">to you</span>.&nbsp;
    Both mathematical analysis and actual numerical computation will be required
    on your project.&nbsp; See the subject suggestions below.&nbsp; For those of
    you who are graduate students, obvious advice is to pick a project in
    consultation with your advisor.<br>
    <br>
    <b><font size="+1">Timing and Due Dates:</font></b><br>
    <ul>
      <li>You will submit a short <span style="font-weight: bold;">Version 1.0
          on Friday 4/6 at class time</span></li>
      <li><span style="font-weight: bold;"></span>You will submit a final <span
          style="font-weight: bold;">Version 2.0 on Thursday 5/8 at 5pm</span>.</li>
    </ul>
    <br>
    Suggestions on content and requirements on length and format follow.<br>
    <big><br>
    </big>Furthermore, a presentation of the project is required.&nbsp; The
    presentation can be either oral (10 minutes) or on a poster.&nbsp; These
    presentations are important to the class, as the class will act as
    consultants to the presenter.&nbsp; We will construct a schedule for this,
    probably in the second-to-last regular week of class.
    <p><big style="font-weight: bold;">Subjects for your project:</big>&nbsp;
      You should pick a <span style="font-style: italic;">continuum
        mathematical model</span> like<br>
    </p>
    <ul>
    </ul>
    <ol>
      <li>a (single or small system of) partial differential equation(s), or </li>
      <li>a (single or small system of) delay differential equation(s), or </li>
      <li>a single stochastic differential equation.</li>
    </ol>
    <ul>
    </ul>
    <p><span style="font-style: italic;">These are the only allowed
        possibilities.&nbsp; </span>On the version 1.0 submission,<span style="font-style: italic;">
        identify which one of these </span>[1,2,3]<span style="font-style: italic;">
        it is!</span><br>
    </p>
    <p>Most ordinary differential equation problems lead to numerical analysis
      rather unlike the content of the course, and thus are not allowed.&nbsp; <br>
    </p>
    <p>You will do a numerical analysis of a particular problem for your
      model.&nbsp; Your particular problem, namely the question you are trying
      to answer by numerical analysis, could be<br>
    </p>
    <ul>
    </ul>
    <ol style="list-style-type: lower-alpha;">
      <li>an initial and boundary value problem, or</li>
      <li>a boundary value problem, or</li>
      <li>a stability or "eigen" analysis (i.e. finding the modes of a system),
        or<br>
      </li>
      <li>an inverse problem.<br>
      </li>
    </ol>
    <ol>
      <ol>
      </ol>
    </ol>
    <ol>
    </ol>
    <span style="font-style: italic;"></span>Again, on the version 1.0
    submission, <span style="font-style: italic;">you must identify which one
      of these </span>[a,b,c,d]<span style="font-style: italic;"> you are
      doing!&nbsp; </span>In rare cases your problem may be in a fifth category
    and you will want to clearly identify that, but talk to me in advance.<br>
    <br>
    <big><span style="font-weight: bold;">Subject suggestions:</span></big>&nbsp;
These
suggestions
    appear alphabetically, thus in no particular order.&nbsp; They are all
    basically in categories 1a,1b,1c in the above taxonomy.&nbsp; Other
    possibilities are allowed.&nbsp; There is varying intrinsic difficulty to
    the standard instances of these suggested problems.&nbsp; I know enough
    about each of these to be able to advise on how much you should include so
    as to avoid becoming bogged down.&nbsp; Also I know enough to be able to
    "weight for difficulty" at the time of grading.&nbsp; For version 1.0 you
    must give several references.&nbsp; Please google the suggestion below if
    you find it interesting; look for a wikipedia page for sure.<br>

    <big><span style="font-weight: bold;">Content of your project:</span></big>&nbsp;
For
your
    chosen scheme or schemes applied to your chosen continuum mathematical
    model, you will do a numerical <span style="font-style: italic;">analysis</span>,
    in addition to a computed example. In particular, three things are <span style="font-style: italic;">required</span>:<br>
    <ol style="list-style-type: upper-alpha;">
      <li>numerical <span style="font-style: italic;">analysis</span></li>
      <li>practical computation<br>
      </li>
      <li>discussion of scientific/engineering meaning (including conclusions
        about the role/meaning of your particular computation)<br>
      </li>
    </ol>
    Note the first part: You must make some attempt to understand and explain
    the <span style="font-style: italic;">efficiency, stability,</span> and<span
      style="font-style: italic;"> accuracy</span> of your numerical
    scheme(s).&nbsp; In particular, for each of these actions you must ask
    whether it is possible and meaningful to do so, and if so you should do it;
    I expect you to do at least two of these analyses:<br>
    <ol style="list-style-type: lower-roman;">
      <li>compute truncation error</li>
      <li>do stability analysis<br>
      </li>
      <li>prove convergence [<span style="font-style: italic;">rarely possible</span>]<br>
      </li>
      <li>assess the computational cost of the algorithm</li>
      <li>manufacture (or otherwise find) an exact solution, and verify with it.<br>
      </li>
    </ol>
    On the other hand, I do not expect you to <em>derive</em> the equations of
    the continuum model.&nbsp; That is a subject for other courses.&nbsp;
    However, do briefly explain the physical/engineering context as a way of
    introducing the problem.&nbsp; Carefully state the equations of the model,
    giving precise references as to a source of the derivation.&nbsp; Explain
    the symbols you use; you <span style="font-style: italic;">must</span>
    explain symbols that are not already used in Morton &amp; Mayers as you use
    them.<br>
    <br>
    You should state the type of the problem (i.e. "... an initial/boundary
    problem for a nonlinear evolution equation of parabolic type..." or "... an
    inverse problem for a linear, elliptic boundary value problem..." or "... an
    initial value problem for a delay differential equation ...") as precisely
    as possible.<br>
    <br>
    You are required to do some practical computation in <span style="font-style: italic;">Matlab.</span>&nbsp;
    I do not expect you to produce a production quality code.&nbsp; Rather, your
    goal should be a functional and readable prototype.&nbsp; (Build something
    you can build upon!)&nbsp; Please use <span style="font-style: italic;">Matlab</span>'s
    built-in numerical linear algebra, and don't write your own.&nbsp; In some
    cases it will be appropriate to use <em>Matlab's</em> built-in ODE or root
    solvers.&nbsp; You don't need to use <span style="font-style: italic;">Matlab</span>
    tricks, but generally learning to vectorize and avoid loops will help you
    understand.<br>
    <br>
    You may look for methods other than finite differences for your practical
    computation, for instance finite volume, finite element, or spectral
    methods.&nbsp; But, because these methods differ both in implementation and
    analysis from what is addressed in class, working with them will be
    intrinsically harder because the required numerical analysis will be
    harder.&nbsp; See me if you want your project to go in this direction.<br>
    <br>
    In what follows I state what <span style="font-style: italic;">you</span>
    will turn in at various stages, but some of the work is mine, too.&nbsp; I
    will be giving you feedback on version 1.0!&nbsp; And please come and talk
    talk to me about your project at any stage.<br>
    <br>
    <p><big style="font-weight: bold;">Length and format of project version 1.0
        (due Friday 4/9):&nbsp; </big><big><small>The point here is to <big style="font-style: italic;">do
            a little bit of everything that will go into the final product.</big><big><small>&nbsp;
              Version 1.0 should be a useful skeleton on which to build Version
              2.0.&nbsp; It needs to be readable but it need not be polished.</small></big><br>
        </small></big></p>
    <p><big><small>The length should be between 5 and 10 pages total.&nbsp;
          Please include the following 7 section headings:<br>
        </small></big></p>
    <ol>
      <li><span style="font-weight: bold;">Introduction</span> (including
        scientific/engineering context and sketch/gloss of the numerical
        analysis you do)<br>
      </li>
      <li><span style="font-weight: bold;">Continuum Model and Problem</span>
        (here should go the PDE itself, etc, and clear specification of the
        particular problem including boundary conditions and parameters; give
        meaning of symbols; include a not-completely-trivial exact solution if
        you can here or in an appendix)</li>
      <li><span style="font-weight: bold;">Numerical Scheme</span> (state the
        method, discuss the reasons for this choice, discuss implementability
        and efficiency; small excerpts of the code may go here)<br>
      </li>
      <li><span style="font-weight: bold;">Analysis</span> (truncation error,
        stability, convergence, cost of algorithm, verification results)<br>
      </li>
      <li><span style="font-weight: bold;">Results</span> or <span style="font-weight: bold;">Conclusion</span><br>
      </li>
      <li style="font-weight: bold;">References<span style="font-weight: normal;">&nbsp;
          (at least three; quality matters)</span><br>
      </li>
      <li><span style="font-weight: bold;">Appendix/Appendices</span> (put the
        actual codes here, tangential analysis or computation, failed attempts
        if significant)</li>
    </ol>
    The Results/Conclusion part should be quite short, and may be empty, in
    version 1.0 because you are likely not able to draw definitive conclusions
    yet.&nbsp; <big><small>I recommend an electronic form so that version 1.0
        can be modified into version 2.0 most easily.</small></big><br>
    <br>
    <big style="font-weight: bold;">Length and format of project version 2.0
      (due Wednesday 5/9):&nbsp;</big><big><small> Fill out the version 1.0
        skeleton, of course.&nbsp; You will undoubtedly need to alter your
        earlier plans, so don't worry if version 2.0 has different computational
        or analytical details than version 1.0.&nbsp; Version 2.0 is final, so I
        encourage you to make it a little bit clean-and-neat.&nbsp; Please use
        ordinary 8.5 by 11 paper and staple it in the upper left corner.&nbsp;
        Please do not put it in a folder, etc.; I will have a stack of these
        things to grade and I don't need yours to take up extra space.</small></big><big><small>&nbsp;
The
length
        should be between <big><span style="font-style: italic;">15 and 30
            pages total</span></big> and should include the same sections as
        described for Version 1.0.&nbsp; Please make it double-sided if
        possible.</small></big><br>
